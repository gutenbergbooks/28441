<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>AT THE PALACE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;You may stay down here until nine
o&#8217;clock if you like,&#8221; said Bridget. &#8220;It&#8217;s awful
cold upstairs. Be sure to wrap yourself good
in the old blanket. And put a little coal on
the range. If you let my fire go out, I&#8217;ll
skin you alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Marilla first heard that threat she
shuddered all over. If you scratched a
little bit of skin off it hurt dreadfully. But
Bridget never did it. Sometimes she hit
her a slap on the shoulder. She couldn&#8217;t
even bear to skin a rabbit. &#8220;What do you
mean by it?&#8221; Marilla gained courage to ask
once, when she came to feel at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. My mother used to
say it. Sometimes she took a strap to us, but
she wasn&#8217;t ever real hard.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>Marilla knew about the strap in Bethany
Home though she didn&#8217;t often get it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember about the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night!&#8221; Bridget was off.</p>
<p>She always took two or three evenings
out in the week and had Sunday afternoon
instead of Thursday because they had late
dinners during the week. She was very
excellent help, so Mrs. Borden let her have
her own way.</p>
<p>It was nice and warm in the kitchen; clean,
too. Bridget couldn&#8217;t abide a dirty kitchen.
Marilla had wiped the dishes, scoured out
the sink and set the chairs straight around.
It was a basement kitchen with a dining room
above. The front was the furnace cellar,
the middle for vegetables and what Bridget
called truck.</p>
<p>Marilla sat in the little old rocking chair
and put her feet on the oven hearth. It was
very nice to rock to and fro and no babies to
tend nor Jack to bother with. She sang a
few hymns she knew, she said over several,
little poems she had learned and spelled a
few words. Bridget had turned the gas low,
and she couldn&#8217;t reach it without getting on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
a chair or she could have read. So she told
herself a story that she had read.</p>
<p>It was very comfortable. She was getting
a bit sleepy. Suppose she took a teeny nap as
she did sometimes when she was waiting
for Bridget. So she shook up the old cushion,
brought up the stool, sat on that and laid
her head in the chair. And now she wasn&#8217;t
a bit sleepy. She thought of the stove and
put on some coal, lest she <i>might</i> fall asleep.</p>
<p>She hoped it would be warmer tomorrow
when she took out the twins. Then she would
venture to stop at the book store window and
look at the pictures on the magazine covers.
There was a baby that looked so like the twins
it made her laugh. She didn&#8217;t think the twins
pretty at all. They had round chubby faces
and almost round eyes, and mouths that
looked as if they were just ready to whistle,
and brown fuzzy hair without a bit of curl
in it. But they <i>were</i> good, &#8220;as good as
kittens,&#8221; their mother said. She did so
wish she had a kitten. She had brought such
a pretty one from the store one day, a real
maltese with black whiskers, but Bridget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
said she couldn&#8217;t have a cat forever round
under her feet and made her take it back.</p>
<p>Jack was past five and very pretty, but
bad as he could be. Bridget said he was a
&#8220;holy terror,&#8221; but she thought holiness was
goodness and didn&#8217;t see the connection. He
was a terror, that any one could see.</p>
<p>There was a queer shady look in the corners.
She wasn&#8217;t a bit afraid. The children at
Bethany Home weren&#8217;t allowed to be. She
liked this a great deal better. She wasn&#8217;t
compelled to eat her whole breakfast off of
oatmeal, and always had such lovely desserts
for dinner. And sometimes Mrs. Borden
gave her and Jack a banana or a bit of candy.
Oh, yes, she would much rather live here
even if Jack was bad and pinched her occasionally
though his mother slapped him for it, or
pinched him back real hard.</p>
<p>What made this lovely, rosy, golden light
in the room? It was like a soft sunset. She
had been saying over a lot of Mother Goose
rhymes; of course she was too old for such
nonsense and Jack didn&#8217;t like them. And in
&#8220;One, two, buckle my shoe,&#8221; she wondered
which she liked best: &#8220;Nineteen, twenty,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
my stomach&#8217;s empty,&#8221; or &#8220;nineteen, twenty,
I&#8217;ve got a plenty.&#8221; That was Bethany
Home where you only had so much for supper
and one little cracker. And here there
was plenty. It made her laugh.</p>
<p>And then suddenly there was a pretty little
woman in the room dressed in something soft
and shining and in her hand she held a stick
with a bunch of gay bows at the end. She
was so sweet and smiling that Marilla couldn&#8217;t
feel afraid.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know me, Cinderella?&#8221; she
began, looking at the child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that isn&#8217;t my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t sit in the ashes any more but
I dare say you brush up and carry them out
in the morning. But I don&#8217;t find Cinderellas
often at this time of night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I was Cinderella. I have a little foot
though, only it don&#8217;t look so in these big
brogans. I put some soles inside of them,
bits of velvet carpet and they keep my feet
nice and warm. I do think if the glass slipper
wasn&#8217;t too teeny weeny I could wear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cute one. About the soles, now.
Most children haven&#8217;t any useful ideas,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
she laughed. &#8220;I knew who you were; now can
you guess who I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why if I was Cinderella you&#8217;d be a fairy
godmother. But there ain&#8217;t any such things;
nor Santa Claus. I like the stories about &#8217;em
and I&#8217;m awful sorry. I&#8217;m only Mrs. Borden&#8217;s
bound-out girl, but I like it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221; She gave the most curious,
delightful laugh. &#8220;You are Cinderella and
I am the fairy godmother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla sprang up and studied her. She
was so pretty and her gown looked as if
it was sprinkled with diamond dust. She had
never seen any one like her, but at twelve
her range of observation had been rather
limited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla stood wide eyed and speechless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;you are very beautiful. Oh, I wish
you were a fairy godmother! I&#8217;d like to go
to fairy land. I don&#8217;t think any one would
mind much, but I do believe the twins would
care. Bridget says there isn&#8217;t any such thing
and then she tells about a little girl who was
toted away and had to stay seven years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t stay that long, and times
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
have changed, and you have no envious
sisters. You&#8217;re a rather lonely little body
with no father or mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how did you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, the softest, merriest laugh.</p>
<p>Marilla looked and looked, the little body
was so sweet and mysterious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fairy godmothers know a great many
things. They keep watch over the Cinderellas
and then when they find one to their liking
they appear to her, and then strange things
happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes they are strange,&#8221; said the little
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to go to the ball?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Why I&#8217;m afraid I wouldn&#8217;t know
what to do,&#8221; hesitatingly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen
a ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can dance. I saw you dancing with
an organ grinder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I can dance that way, but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, wouldn&#8217;t I!&#8221; Marilla&#8217;s eyes shone with
delight. &#8220;If you were a fairy godmother you
could put me in some clothes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>Marilla didn&#8217;t believe in it at all, but it
was very funny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then just step out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did with the strangest sort of feeling.
The fairy touched her with the wand. Her
clothes fell in a heap. The big shoes dropped
off. There was a shimmery pink silk frock with
lace and ribbons and the daintiest pink kid
slippers with diamond buckles and pink silk
stockings with lovely clocks. She went dancing
around the kitchen light as a feather, her
eyes shining, her cheeks like roses, her lips
full of smiles. She was fairly bewitched.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do,&#8221; exclaimed godmother, and
she threw a beautiful white cloak about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t a pumpkin in the house
and Bridget catches all the mice and burns
them up. So you can&#8217;t make a carriage&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one at the door.&#8221; The hall seemed
all alight and they went out. Yes, there
was a coach with lamps on both sides, two
horses and a driver, besides a footman who
helped them in with a fine air, and drove off
as gay as if it was Christmas night, though it
were really March.</p>
<p>The streets were alight, the windows shining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
in splendor. Marilla had never seen anything
like it. Presently they stopped at what seemed
to the little girl a great palace with broad
white marble steps and tall carved columns
lighted by myriads of colored lights and the
vestibule was hung with vines. There were
statues standing round that looked like real
people only they were so white from top
to toe. Then they went up another beautiful
stairway that led to a gallery where
there were numbers of inviting little rooms,
and throngs of elegantly dressed people, not
any larger than boys and girls. A maid took
off their wraps, and brushed Marilla&#8217;s hair
and it fell in golden rings all over her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What beautiful hair,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;just
like threads of silk. You must let it grow long.
And such lovely eyes; but she&#8217;s thin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, rather,&#8221; said godmother, &#8220;But she
has dancing feet. She&#8217;s a real Cinderella.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so many of them and only one
Prince. What a pity!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But each has her turn, and they are very
happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Marilla glanced around the gallery.
That was well lighted and had a cushioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
seat against the wall. Groups were sitting
together or rambling about. And a great circular
room, down stairs lighted by a magnificent
chandelier whose prisms seemed in
constant motion and rayed off every imaginable
color with a faint musical sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! oh! oh!&#8221; and her eyes were full of
tears though her lips smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we will go down,&#8221; said godmother.</p>
<p>That was by another way. But this place
was a perfect land of delight. She had never
read of anything like it, but the Arabian
Nights had not come in her way. Some were
dancing about informally, some talking and
laughing. There were the most elegantly
attired boys in silks and velvets made in all
pretty fashions. Silk stockings and light
colored pumps, jackets trimmed with frills
of lace, some with satin trousers wide enough
for petticoats at the bottom and blue velvet
sailor collars. There was no end of fancy attire.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is to be your knight, Sir Aldred. And
this is the new Cinderella. Take good care
of her until the Prince comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed with most enchanting grace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many of them!&#8221; he said, as
he took her hand, &#8220;But she is the prettiest
of them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The knight gave her hand a little squeeze
and she turned rosy red.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come this way,&#8221; and he led her along. It
was odd to be introduced as Cinderella, but
everybody was so sweet and cordial that she
kept smiling and bowing.</p>
<p>Presently a cluster of bells sounded and
everybody fell into line along the outer edge
of the beautiful building. It was a grand
march and the tapping of the feet seemed
like an encore to the music. Then the first
couple stepped out on the floor. Everybody
dances in fairy land that is presided over by
godmothers. Oh, it was just enchanting!</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you tired?&#8221; Sir Aldred asked presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I never imagined anything so
utterly delightful. And the splendid dressing.
Are there many Cinderellas here?&#8221; a little
timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. They love to come, but the new
one always dances with the Prince. He will
come in presently for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall feel afraid.&#8221; She really felt
tears rushing to her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you will not, for he is truly most delightful,
a regular Prince Charming. You see,
it is different in fairy land. You forget for
awhile who you have been. That&#8217;s the charm
of it. And you&#8217;re such a lovely dancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and&mdash;is there any glass slipper?&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed to remember something about
that.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s in the story. The Prince isn&#8217;t
looking for a wife now. And you couldn&#8217;t
dance in a stiff glass slipper. It might shiver to
pieces. What pretty little feet you have! And
such a lovely curly head.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed quite delightful to be praised
and she was glad she pleased him.</p>
<p>Then there was a curious quivering about
the place as if every one was drawing a long
breath, and the lights were mysterious, while
all the little bells twinkled. And there stood
the Prince.</p>
<p>He was taller than any of the others and
very handsome. As for his attire, I couldn&#8217;t
begin to describe it, it was so resplendent
with silk and velvet and jewels.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>Sir Aldred led the little lady up to him and
said: &#8220;This is Cinderella.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prince bowed and pressed a kiss upon
her hand and she was glad it was lily white
and not rough and red.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad you are here Cinderella,
I hope you will have a happy time. You
look so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh I know I shall.&#8221; She blushed and cast
her eyes down in such a sweet fashion that
he really longed to kiss the lids.</p>
<p>Then the music commenced and they
stepped out as if they had danced together
all their lives. The others formed a circle and
went round them, bowing as they passed.
There were such fascinating figures, changing
frequently, each one prettier than the last.
She wondered how they could remember; how
<i>she</i> could do it. They all looked so lovely.
It certainly was fairy land.</p>
<p>Now and then the Prince bent over and
said something charming to her as if she had
been a fine lady and the odd thing was that
she could answer him readily. The music
began to go slower and died in softest melody.
Then he turned and said&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now we will go out and have some refreshments.
You must be tired after all
this dancing, but you don&#8217;t look it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I feel as if I could dance all night. I
believe I am bewitched.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her the sweetest smile that any
Cinderella ever had.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad. Sometimes they think
of the ashes and cinders and wonder whether
the pleasure will last. Then the lightness
goes out of their feet and the smiles from their
rosy lips. The thing is to enjoy it while you
are here. You are a very delightful Cinderella;
I must ask godmother to keep a watch over
you. I hope to meet you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The banquet room was beautiful as well;
there was a great oval table with a chandelier
shedding a thousand lights from the gorgeous
prisms. Underneath was a tiny lake full of
blooming water lilies. There were mounds of
fruit and flowers, nuts from all over the world,
piles of cake, candied fruit, ices made in all
kinds of shape. The most beautiful plates
and dishes, glass and crystal and servants
piling up dainties and pouring out fragrant
drinks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>At the head sat the Prince and Cinderella.
He rose and drank to her health and good
fortune with the most exquisite verse and
Sir Aldred returned with a charming reply.
Certainly there were no envious or jealous
sisters. Every one was so merry and talked
with his or her neighbor, and every girl had
a knight who was devoted to her. Were they
all Cinderellas, and had the Prince been as
delightful to them? Every face beamed with
wondrous satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand it at all,&#8221; and she
glanced up wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t have to in fairy land. You
just take all the pleasure that comes. You are
not thinking of all the tomorrows. There will
be something nice and pleasant if you look
for it in the right place. For little Cinderella,
we must not be looking for tomorrow&#8217;s joy.
You cannot find them tonight. There are
flowers that fold their leaves but will open
again tomorrow. You would be short sighted
to sit down and cry tonight about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla was a good deal puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be a happy little Cinderella
when you have been to fairy land. You must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
not lose faith in fairy godmothers. They come
at unexpected times and in different guise.
And that is what keeps the world bright
and the heart young, and sometime the real
Prince comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her heart beat with a mysterious joy. She
was full of gladness.</p>
<p>Then they walked around and all the other
Cinderellas seemed so happy when he smiled
and spoke to them. The beautiful music went
on. Here and there groups were dancing again.</p>
<p>And then it seemed as if a giant caught her
and almost shook her to pieces, and the beautiful
lights wavered and vanished. She was
brought upon her feet with a force that would
have shivered any glass slipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little huzzy! What are you doing up
this time of night, instead of asleep in
bed? Rouse up! rouse up! Lucky you didn&#8217;t
let my fire go out this cold night! Come,
hustle!&#8221;</p>
<p>There seemed a sort of crash. Marilla
glanced around with half-opened eyes. Yes,
this was the old kitchen. There was Bridget
with the lighted end of a candle in the tin
candlestick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come! get along, sleepy head.&#8221; She gave
her a push up the stairs and through the halls,
half scolding her but not cross. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder
the gobble sirs didn&#8217;t come after you. If
you&#8217;d been carried off now! It&#8217;s awful cold.
I&#8217;d sleep in my stockings and they&#8217;ll be good
and warm in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla hustled off her clothes, wrapped
herself in an old blanket and tumbled into
bed in a little heap. But there was some
mysterious music floating through her brain
and a fragrance in the air. The Prince smiled
down into her eyes, and the fairy godmother
she should always believe in. For she had
been to real fairy land; that was the truth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>JACK</h3>
</div>
<p>The Bordens were nice, ordinary people
enjoying life in a commonplace way. There was
Mr. Jack Borden, the junior partner in a
fairly successful law firm, his wife an averagely
nice, sensible body, Miss Florence, her
husband&#8217;s sister, a bright girl of three and
twenty, whose lover was in South America
on a five years&#8217; contract, with one year yet
to serve.</p>
<p>After the twins were born they tried a
grown nursemaid who bored them by sitting
around when she was upstairs and
making many excuses to get down to the
kitchen, where she disputed with Bridget who
declared one or the other of them must go,
and they simply could not give up Bridget.
The babies slept a good deal of the time and
only cried when they were hungry. The mother
and aunt thought them the dearest things and
their father was as proud of them as a man
could well be. If it wasn&#8217;t for giving them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
an airing now and then&mdash;but when it came
pleasant weather they <i>must</i> be taken out.</p>
<p>Aunt Hetty Vanderveer who was queer
and going on to eighty, who couldn&#8217;t live
with a relative for they always wanted to
borrow her money, got tangled up in a house
on which she had a mortgage, and called her
grandnephew, Mr. John Borden to her rescue.
She took the house and persuaded them to
come there, and she would live with them
on certain conditions. She was to have the
third floor front room and the store room, get
her breakfast and tea and take dinner with
them though it was their luncheon. Night
dinners she despised. She entertained herself
sewing patchwork, a dressmaker sent
her bags of silk pieces; knitting baby socks
and stockings and reading novels. They did
get along very well though it made a good
deal of running up and down.</p>
<p>The spare room and Bridget&#8217;s room was
on this floor. On the second, two sleeping
chambers, the nursery and the bath. Down
stairs a long parlor and a dining room, with
a basement kitchen which Bridget declared
she liked above all things. A woman came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
do the washing and ironing, Bridget&#8217;s nephew
took out the ashes and swept the stoop and
sidewalk. Bridget was a strong, healthy,
good natured Irish woman when you didn&#8217;t
meddle with her, and the ladies were very
glad not to meddle. But some one for the
babies they must have.</p>
<p>One day a friend came in for a subscription
to some of her charities and heard the appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll tell you just what to do,&#8221; she
said &#8220;Go over to the Bethany Home, you take
the car out to the Melincourt Road that
passes it. Ask for Mrs. Johnson. They have
two girls; they put them out when they are
twelve. And since you only want some one
to amuse the babies and take them out, and
she will be growing older all the time, you see,
you can bring her up in your ways. Yes,
that is what I&#8217;d do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden followed the advice. There
was a stout, rather vacant looking German
girl, a good worker who delighted in scrubbing
and scouring and who would make an excellent
kitchen maid. The other was Marilla
Bond, an orphan with no relatives that any
one knew; a fair, nice looking intelligent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
child, with light curly hair cropped close,
rather slim, and with a certain ready, alert
look that was attractive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden brought her home for a
month&#8217;s trial. She took to the babies at
once, and Jack took to her. Oddly enough, so
did Bridget. She had such a quaint sweet
way of saying, &#8220;Yes&#8217;m&#8221; and &#8220;No&#8217;m;&#8221; she
did what she was told to do with alacrity, she
ran up and down stairs on numberless errands.
She was a very good reader and at first, Jack
kept her busy in this respect. But she wanted
to hear about lions and tigers and men killing
them and Indian fights and matters that
didn&#8217;t please the little girl at all. Mother
Goose was babyish.</p>
<p>The twins sat on a blanket on the floor
and sometimes rolled around a little. She
played with them, talked to them and they
really listened to the stories that she acted
off and laughed gleefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;They certainly <i>are</i> intelligent,&#8221; Aunt
Florence said with pride.</p>
<p>On nice sunny days when it was not very
cold she took them out in the carriage. They
were carried down and put in it, then brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
up again. Their mother &#8220;wasn&#8217;t going to
have any nurse breaking their backs by a
fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when the month of probation was ended,
Marilla was bound to Mr. and Mrs. John
Borden, to be clothed and fed and sent to
school for half a year. She really did like her
new home. Only if it wasn&#8217;t for Jack! He
pinched her sometimes, and once he kicked
her but his mother gave him a good trouncing.</p>
<p>The twins had some bread and milk and
were put to bed at six. Then Cinderella went
down stairs but not to sit in the ashes. She
did numerous things for Bridget and they had
a cozy dinner together, always a dessert, and
they were so good.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Jack only wouldn&#8217;t run away,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;You see I can&#8217;t leave the babies, and
I am so afraid he will get lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him get lost then; that&#8217;ll bring his
mother to her senses, and you tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did come near it one day. She took the
babies home and explained and then said
she would go and find him.</p>
<p>Aunt Florence went with her. They had
quite a long search and finally asked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
policeman, who said: &#8220;there was a little boy
down here on a stoop, crying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack, sure enough, and he was very glad to
be found. His mother kept him in the house
for two days and then he promised to be very
good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you make any trouble you shall
not go out for a whole week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The babies hadn&#8217;t gone much farther than
&#8220;<i>agoo, agoo</i>,&#8221; but Marilla tried her best to
make them talk. They each had a rubber doll
and the child would dance them up and down
and make them turn somersaults and stand
on their heads, and invent every sort of grotesque
action.</p>
<p>Jack was a good looking little fellow and
had been spoiled in the earlier years. He was
a little afraid of his father, and sometimes his
mother <i>would</i> make him mind, but he was
very full of badness.</p>
<p>Aunt Florence wanted some silk and twist
and spools of cotton one morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could find your way down to Grand
street where the stores are, couldn&#8217;t you
Marilla&mdash;where we went that Saturday night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Down there opposite the park.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s a big store. Day and Belden.
I&#8217;ll write it out for you and you may take
my Leggy bag. Be sure and put the change in
it before you leave the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; with her sweet accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;She may take Jack, and the babies will
have a good long nap. Now Jack, you must be
very good and mind Marilla, or you shan&#8217;t
go out again for a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack said he would. He looked very pretty
in his brown coat with its fur collar, and his
brown mittens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a penny a&#8217;cause I&#8217;m gonter be
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait and see whether you are going
to good or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack stood it pretty well until they reached
the little park which was a rather long triangle
with a few trees in it. Here he made a sudden
dash and was off like a squirrel.</p>
<p>Marilla was after him. &#8220;Go it sonny,&#8221;
cried a man laughing, but she gained on him
and took him by the arm with a jerk that
nearly capsized them both.</p>
<p>He could not pull away. She marched him
across the street and found the store, and asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
for the notion department. There were the
spools of all kinds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you please open the bag and find an
order in it,&#8221; she said in a very nice manner.</p>
<p>The girl smiled. &#8220;Three spools of silk, two
twist, black cotton number 60, white cotton,
60, 70 and 80.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put up the order and sent the money
whizzing to the cash clerk, handing the bag to
Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that thing like a railroad for?&#8221;
asked Jack, keeping his eyes upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That carries the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! I wish I had one at home!&#8221;</p>
<p>The change came back. Marilla opened
the bag to put it in and used both hands.
Jack was off like a flash, turning here and
there through the aisles. Clear down to the
end of the store was a toy department.
Marilla was almost up to him when he grabbed
a handful of toys and ran on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do please stop him!&#8221; she cried to the
clerk.</p>
<p>Two or three joined the chase. Finding they
were gaining on him he threw down the
articles and stamped furiously upon them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is all this row?&#8221; asked the floor
walker.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little boy snatched the toys and ran,&#8221;
said the young clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, how could you!&#8221; cried Marilla.</p>
<p>Jack laughed insolently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he your brother?&#8221; in a sharp tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only the nurse girl, please, sir,&#8221; and
Marilla began to cry.</p>
<p>The floor walker shook Jack until he was
purple in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little thief! You ought to go to the
Station House. I&#8217;ve half a mind to send you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t,&#8221; pleaded Marilla. She
stooped to pick up some of the broken pieces.
&#8220;I think his mother will pay for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s his mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. John Borden, 138 Arch Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What brought you in the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sent to buy some things. They are
in this bag, and&mdash;the change.&#8221;</p>
<p>A gentleman came up to inquire into the
matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;These children ought to be taught a
lesson. That Granford boy carried off an
expensive toy the other night and I sent a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
note to his mother that brought her to terms
at once. See what is the value of these things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The counter girl began to place the pieces
together and examine the marks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is&mdash;sixty-seven cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too much. We&#8217;ll send a note to his
mother, and young sir, if you dare to come
in this store again, we&#8217;ll send you to jail, I
think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite a crowd had collected. One lady
looked at him sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s little Jack Borden,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla told the story over.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Jack flung out. &#8220;I just
stamped on the old things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that to Mrs. Borden,&#8221; and the man
handed Marilla a folded note. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll see
you out, young sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla trembled from head to foot. She
was very much ashamed though none of it
had been her fault. But what would Mrs.
Borden say? What if Mrs. Borden should
send her back to the Bethany Home! Oh, she
did not want to go. But she could not manage
Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>The young man stopped short when they
reached the house, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t comin&#8217; in just
now,&#8221; he said decidedly.</p>
<p>When Marilla was in the house she always
answered the door bell. Bridget protested she
could not run up and down so much and she
didn&#8217;t always hear it. Miss Florence came
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marilla, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack has run off down the street. And, oh,
Miss Florence&#8221;&mdash;ending in a fit of crying.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter? Did you lose the
money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, here is everything and the change.
But Jack&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come upstairs and tell us.&#8221; Miss Florence
opened the bag, counted the change, took out
the parcels and a note.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man told me to bring it home. I held
Jack&#8217;s hand tight all the way down to the store
and gave the girl the bag because I couldn&#8217;t
open it with one hand. She took out the money
and put in the parcel and gave it to me and
said, &#8216;Wait for the change.&#8217; When it came
she handed it to me and turned away, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
I was putting it in the bag Jack ran off. You
know how the paths go in and out. I looked
and looked and saw him over at the toy counter,
but before I could reach him he snatched
a lot of things and ran, and the girl went after
him, too, and then he threw them down and
stamped on them and ever so many people
came and the man was very angry&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla cried as if her little heart had been
broken. Miss Florence handed the note to her
sister who had been listening in amaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla,&#8221; began Florence, &#8220;you have done
the errand very well. Don&#8217;t cry, child. We
shouldn&#8217;t have let Jack go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden&#8217;s face turned very red. &#8220;A
great fuss about sixty-seven cents. Accidents
will happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But throwing them down and stamping
on them was no accident, Amy. That child
is dreadful. He doesn&#8217;t mind Marilla when
he is out of our sight, hardly when he is in it.
And I don&#8217;t know what the babies would do
without her.&#8221;</p>
<p>They began to cry now. They always cried
together and lustily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jack?&#8221; asked his mother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He ran down the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about Jack, Marilla; you go
down and get the babies&#8217; bread and milk
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla went and of course told the mishap
to Bridget.</p>
<p>&#8220;That young&#8217;un &#8217;ll get in prison some day;
you see! He&#8217;s a rascal through and through, a
mean dirty spalpeen, a holy terror! And if
they set to blaming you, I&#8217;ll threaten to leave;
that I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll send me back to
Bethany Home?&#8221; in a distressed tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d be big fools to! I don&#8217;t know where
they&#8217;d get another like you. If that Jack was
mine, I&#8217;d skin him alive and hang him out
bare naked, the mean little thief! And the
missus knows he&#8217;s bad through and through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla took the basin of dinner upstairs.
The babies had hushed their crying and gave
a sort of joyous howl at the sight. Florence
had talked her sister-in-law into a more
reasonable view of the case. Then the babies
were fed and comforted and sat on the blanket
with playthings about them. They could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
climb up a little by chairs, but they were
too heavy for much activity.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden picked up her slipper and went
down stairs, opening the front door. Jack was
slowly sauntering back and she beckoned to
him. He had begun to think it was feeding
time as well as the babies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was gone, to put &#8217;em back&mdash;&#8221; he began&mdash;</p>
<p>She took off his pretty coat and then she
did spank him for good. Meanwhile the bell
rang for lunch. She put him on a chair in the
end of the parlor and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you sit there. If you dare to get up
you&#8217;ll get some more. And all the lunch you
can have will be a piece of bread without any
butter.&#8221; And she left the door open so she
could see if he ventured down.</p>
<p>But after the bread he went up stairs and
straight to Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;You old tell tale! You&#8217;ll be rid on a rail
and dumped in the river,&#8221; and he kicked at
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man sent a note&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; interposed his mother sternly.</p>
<p>Then the babies were bundled up and
carried down stairs, well wrapped up for their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
ride. Manila enjoyed the outing when she
didn&#8217;t have Jack. She went down again by
the stores. There were two she delighted in,
book and stationery stores. One window was
full of magazines and papers, and she read
bits here and there. She was so fond of
reading and she would piece out the page she
read with her own imaginings. She always
staid out two hours, more when it was pleasant,
and brought back the babies, rosy and bright
eyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; and his father took him on his
knee that evening, &#8220;you have been a very
bad boy today. You have been a thief. Suppose
the man had sent you to the Station
House?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t a&#8217; gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you would have had to. Thieves
break laws and are sent to prison. And there
you broke up the toys. You must never go in
a store again without your mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;rilla took me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And mother and Auntie supposed they
could trust you. Now they can&#8217;t. You will
have to be watched and punished, and I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
going to do it. There&#8217;ll be no more Sunday
walks with me, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I go alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until you are a good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked rather sober, but his father
saw he was not making much impression. And
presently his mother put him to bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know what to do with Jack,&#8221;
his mother said on her return, taking up her
sewing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to this,&#8221; and Mr. Borden read from
the paper an account of three boys who had
managed to enter a grocery store and steal
some quite valuable stock. Ages, seven, nine
and ten.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather bury Jack tomorrow than have
such a thing published about him,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Jack used to be so nice,&#8221; returned
his mother with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve indulged him too much, and we
have idealized childhood too much; we&#8217;ve
laughed at his smart tricks and his saucy replies,
and tried high moral suasion, but
we must turn over a new leaf. When he is
bad he must be punished severely enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
to make an impression. Are you sure of that
girl, Marilla?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She&#8217;s truthful and so sweet to the
babies. Bridget says she wouldn&#8217;t even touch
a piece of cake without asking for it. But I
think she does sometimes shield Jack. He
has a nasty way of pinching and I do slap him
for it. I&#8217;m afraid of his pinching the babies.
But we never do leave him alone with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; began Florence, &#8220;why not send
him to Kindergarten. The new term is just
beginning. I think boys ought to be with
other boys. And those classes are made so
entertaining. The many employments take
a child&#8217;s mind off of mischief, and they are
trained in manners. Oh dear! think, what a
blessed time we should have!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but it is a good idea,&#8221; said
Jack&#8217;s father. &#8220;He will have to mix with
children some time, and our training hasn&#8217;t
proved such a brilliant success. Oh, I do want
him to grow up a nice boy. But boys seem
an awful risk now-a-days. I never knew so
many youthful criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know who that woman was who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
recognized Jack in the store. That mortifies
me awfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it will get told all over, I know,&#8221;
returned Aunt Florence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, children do out grow a good many of
these disagreeable capers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next night Mr. Borden brought home
something in a paper bag and Jack begged
the bag &#8220;to bust,&#8221; watching his father as
he shook out a leather strap cut in thongs
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jack, every time you do any naughty,
ugly thing, I am going to punish you with this
strap. You must not pinch Marilla or the
babies, not kick any one nor tell what isn&#8217;t
true. We want you to be a pretty good boy,
otherwise you will have to be sent to the
reform school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to go to the &#8217;form school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; was the comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;d run away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a high fence all around, and you
couldn&#8217;t climb it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d holler like fury.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And be put in a dark dungeon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There was a man in a story who dug his
way out. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arguing was useless. He was such a little
fellow, but fertile in expedients.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want ever to use this strap on my
little boy. I hope he will be good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is good and what is bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to bed, Jack. You&#8217;re getting silly.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Monday morning Jack went to Kindergarten.
The house was like another place.
And Jack was very much entertained. He
soon learned what a &#8220;punch below the belt&#8221;
meant, and a &#8220;biff in the eye&#8221; and several
other fighting terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re a set of gumps,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;They can&#8217;t read right off, they&#8217;ve got to
write it, and I can read most anything and spell
words, too. But they make pictures and
lovely things, and sing. Yes, I like to go.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>PLAYING HOOKEY</h3>
</div>
<p>Marilla thought she had lovely times with
Jack in school, but she did have to run up and
down so much that some nights her little
legs fairly ached. But now she took the babies
out to the big park where she could sit and
watch the merry children at play and the
beds of flowers coming out, and there were
the funny pussy willows and the long tails
of yellow forsythia and some squirrels running
around, and birds calling to each other.
Then there were pretty children playing about
and some nurse girls that she talked to. She
felt so rested sitting here, and sometimes her
thoughts went back to the March night when
she had fallen asleep by the warm stove and
had that wonderful, beautiful dream. She
felt very happy over it. And the Cinderella
meant all the little hard worked girls who
had few pleasures. Oh, she wished they could
all have one night in that magic fairy land.</p>
<p>She was learning to sew a little as well, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
she thought she should like it if there was a
little more time. But the babies began to
crawl around now and Violet would pick up
anything and put it in her mouth; so you had
to watch her every moment. And though
they generally slept from ten to twelve,
there was the door to answer, little things to
be done for Aunt Hetty whose bell would
ring just as she had her work fixed ready to
sew. Then likely she would lose her needle.</p>
<p>But she managed somehow to keep very
sweet-tempered. She wished she could go to
school.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see next fall,&#8221; Mrs. Borden said.
&#8220;The twins will be larger and less trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sundays were pretty good; Mr. Borden took
out the children in the afternoon. She had to
help Bridget with the vegetables for dinner,
which was at midday and there was so much
washing-up afterwards, at least drying the
dishes, that there was barely time to go to
Sunday school. But the singing was so
delightful. She sang the pretty hymns over
to the babies. In the evening the family
generally went out or had company. So after
Jack and the babies were abed she used to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
read, unless Jack wouldn&#8217;t go to sleep and
torment her with questions that were unanswerable.</p>
<p>On the whole Jack had been pretty good
for a fortnight. One afternoon Mrs. Borden
had gone out, Miss Florence had some visitors
in the parlor. Marilla had fed the babies
who were laughing and crowing when Aunt
Hetty&#8217;s bell rang. She ran up.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;rilla get me some hot water, quick, and
that aromatic ammonia, I&#8217;m so faint and feel
queer all over. Be quick now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ran down, but could not run up lest
she might spill the water. Aunt Hetty was
gasping for breath, and leaning back in the
big chair. She swallowed a little, then she went
over on Marilla&#8217;s shoulder and the child was
frightened at her ghastly look. There was
the lavender salts&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>Just then there was a succession of screams
from the babies. Could she leave Aunt Hetty?
Miss Florence called her, then ran up stairs
herself.</p>
<p>And this was what had happened; Jack
had come home and finding no one, knew there
was some candy on the closet shelf. And there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
hung the strap. He wondered if it would
hurt very much? The babies looked too
tempting. So he began to strap them and
enjoyed the howling. He was just going to
leave off when Aunt Florence flew into the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, you cruel, wicked boy!&#8221; Then she
seized the strap and he soon had an opportunity
to known how much it hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla! Marilla!&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Florence, something dreadful has
happened to Aunt Hetty, and I&#8217;m fast with
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>She came up. &#8220;Oh, she looks as if she was
dying or dead. Let&#8217;s put her on the lounge
and you go for Bridget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go, quick! I&#8217;ll tell you afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child summoned Bridget and just
ran in to comfort and kiss the babies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, you never&mdash;oh, look at their
poor little hands! You bad, wicked boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you say much, I&#8217;ll give you some&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla snatched at the strap and flung it
upon a high shelf. Jack wiped his eyes and
went out to play. Marilla ran upstairs again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
They were fanning Aunt Hetty and bathing
her face and head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla, will you go to the parlor and ask
that lady to come up here,&mdash;Mrs. Henderson.
Bridget thinks&mdash;oh, and we ought to have a
doctor! I must telephone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then can I stay with the babies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor babies!&#8221; Marilla fairly stopped them
with witch hazel. Their little fat hands and
their shoulders were swollen already. She
kissed them, but she couldn&#8217;t take them both
and they wanted to be cuddled. So she sat
down and hugged them and really cried herself.</p>
<p>Bridget came down, &#8220;She isn&#8217;t dead but
she&#8217;s a mighty hard faint on her. And what
happened to the children?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla explained in a broken voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the murtherin&#8217; little devil! You take
one and I&#8217;ll comfort &#8217;tother. But you can&#8217;t
lift her.&#8221;</p>
<p>No; Marilla couldn&#8217;t lift such a dead weight.
Bridget walked the floor and patted Pansy
and crooned over her, but the hurt was pretty
deep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Aunt Florence came down.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s over the faint. Mrs. Henderson is
going to stay a while. Oh, poor babies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must look after my meat or it&#8217;ll burn,&#8221;
and she gave the baby to Miss Florence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit in the rocking chair and you put her
in my lap, I think she&#8217;s hurt more than Violet.
You see, I ran upstairs when Miss Hetty&#8217;s
bell rang, and she fell on my shoulder, and
I never thought&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave it to him good, and his father&#8217;ll finish
him tonight. Oh, dear! Well, there comes
their mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a hubhub with both babies
crying again. Mrs. Borden laid aside her hat
and coat and took up Violet, sent Marilla
for a pitcher of milk and both babies were
comforted with a drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit on the floor and hold them. They&#8217;re
so heavy. Poor sweet babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sobs ceased after a while. Violet fell
asleep, Pansy was bathed again and grew
quieter. The doctor came and said it was a
bad fainting spell but that Mrs. Vanderveers
heart was weak from age.</p>
<p>Marilla fixed Pansy&#8217;s supper, fed her and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
undressed her, and her mother laid her in the
crib. Then she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go and help Bridget a little with
the dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla arranged the table and the master
of the house came in. Jack sneaked in, also.
Mrs. Henderson staid, so no explanations were
made. Jack was very quiet and behaved
beautifully, but he wanted to go to bed at
once. Violet woke and had her supper and
quiet was restored. Then a man came in
to consult Mr. Borden about some business.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was awful that Jack should go at the
babies so,&#8221; said Mrs. Borden to her sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about telling his father.
You gave him one whipping&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a good hard one. I&#8217;m afraid of boys
getting so used to that mode of punishment
that they don&#8217;t mind it. But father brought
up four boys in that manner and they have
all made nice men. I don&#8217;t see where Jack
gets his badness from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s mother sighed. &#8220;And yet he can be
so lovely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been considering,&#8221; rejoined Florence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
&#8220;Suppose we hold this over his head for a while.
I might talk to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Aunt Florence talked to him very seriously,
and said if he wasn&#8217;t a better boy they
would have to send him off somewhere in the
country where there were no children. She
would not tell his father just now, but if he
ever struck or pinched the babies again she
certainly would, and he would be punished
twice over. He must remember that.</p>
<p>He put his arms around her neck, and kissed
her. &#8220;I&#8217;m awful sorry. I didn&#8217;t think it hurt
so,&#8221; he said naively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Papa will hurt you a great deal more than
I did,&#8221; was her reply.</p>
<p>And then Jack had a sudden accession of
goodness. His teacher was proud of him. How
much was due to his pretty face and winsome
manner, one couldn&#8217;t quite tell, but the
nursery had a lovely rest and Marilla didn&#8217;t
have to watch out every moment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden secretly wished the twins were
prettier. They were too fat, and when she
tried to diet them a little they made a terrible
protest. Here they were fourteen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
months old and couldn&#8217;t walk yet, but they
were beginning to say little words under their
nurse&#8217;s steady training.</p>
<p>Aunt Hetty made light of her attack and
was soon about as usual, but she did not take
long walks and laid on the lounge a good deal.
&#8220;Folks can&#8217;t stay young forever,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m getting to be quite an old lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they began to plan for a summering.</p>
<p>Last year they had not gone anywhere.
Advertisements were answered, and Florence
visited several places. They would take
Marilla of course, she was coming to have a
thin, worn look. Aunt Hetty would visit a
grand niece, who had been begging her to
come. Bridget would stay in the house, she
had no fancy for cantering about. Mrs.
Borden would live at home through the week
and rejoin them on Saturday afternoons.
They must get off soon after school closed.
There was no end of sewing. Some pretty
skirts were altered over for Marilla, as there
was enough for full dresses in them.</p>
<p>The place was on Long Island, a country
house with only two other boarders. It was
barely a quarter of a mile from the seashore,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
with a great orchard and grass all about,
shady places for hammocks and numerous
conveniences, besides moderate board.</p>
<p>Jack had not been an angel all the time.
Some days he wouldn&#8217;t study. Then he
had two fights with boys. He threw stones
at cats&mdash;sometimes dogs, and broke two or
three windows which he didn&#8217;t set out to do.
He was getting tired of school and the weather
was warm.</p>
<p>So one afternoon he thought he would
take a walk instead. He would go out to the
park where they went on Sundays. It was so
warm in school. He was getting quite tired
of the confinement.</p>
<p>He found a group of children and played
with them awhile. Then they ran off home
and he rambled on and on until he came to a
street up a few steps. A wagon was standing
there and two little boys were hanging on
behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, its real fun,&#8221; sang out one of
them. &#8220;You get a good ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack thought it would be. They showed him
how to hold on. The driver had been busy
with an account book and now he touched up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
the horses. &#8220;Hanging on&#8221; wasn&#8217;t so easy
Jack found, and you had to swing your legs
underneath. The man paused again at a
saloon and he dropped off; his hands were
very tired. The man went in the place and
when he came out one of the boys said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! Mister, won&#8217;t you give us a ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed. &#8220;Where you want to
go? I&#8217;m for Roselands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to go there,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, crawl up here. Two of you&#8217;ll have to
sit on the wagon bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to sit with the driver, &#8217;cause
I asked.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a very clean floor to sit on, Jack
thought, and the wagon bumped a good deal,
the beer kegs rattled against each other. But
the boys laughed and called it fun. There was
another stop and then the driver asked who
they were going to see in Roselands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no one. We&#8217;re going just for fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you live?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys all lived at Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jiminy; then you better get out and trot
back. I&#8217;m going over the mountain where
I put up for the night. Mebbe you can get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
a ride back. It&#8217;s two miles down to the place
where I took you in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we better get out,&#8221; replied the biggest
boy. &#8220;Oh, we can soon foot it back. Much
obliged for the ride, Mister.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man nodded.</p>
<p>They sat off quite cheerily. Automobiles
passed them and carriages containing ladies,
one or two loaded trucks. Jack began to get
very tired and lagged. &#8220;Come, hurry up,&#8221;
the biggest boy said. Jack ran a little distance
for a change. He began to wish he was back
in school. Presently a farm wagon came jogging
along.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us a ride?&#8221; The biggest boy&#8217;s name
was Dick and he seemed the spokesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;where ye want to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Newton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I turn off at the crossroads, ye kin ride
that fur.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a great relief. They were quite
jolly again, though Jack didn&#8217;t understand the
fun. But when they dismounted, Dick asked
him where he lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Arch Street.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s clear over there,&#8221; indicating it
with his head. &#8220;Ta ta, little sonny.&#8221;</p>
<p>They both laughed and Jack felt rather
affronted. Over there seemed a long way.
Then it was clouding up and night was coming
on. He went straight along, but now he was
hungry, and his little legs ached. He had been
instructed if he was ever lost to ask the way
to Arch Street. So he asked now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sonny, you&#8217;re a long way from Arch
Street. Keep straight on until you come to
Taylor, then ask again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was a bakery with a pleasant, motherly
woman. He went in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please ma&#8217;am, would you give me a bun?
I&#8217;m lost and I can&#8217;t find my way back to Arch
Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor child! Yes, and here&#8217;s a cake,
beside. Arch Street isn&#8217;t far from the eastern
end of the park. Sit and get rested. Who&#8217;s
your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. John Borden.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, very much.&#8221; Jack rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go straight down three blocks. Then
ask a policeman. Oh, I guess you&#8217;ll get home
safely.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>Jack walked his three blocks. Then there
was a low rumble of thunder. Oh, dear! He
began to cry. Was there never a policeman!</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter bub?&#8221; asked a kindly
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m lost. I can&#8217;t find my way home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arch Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on. We&#8217;ll find it. It&#8217;s bad to be
lost. Where have you been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t tell all the places,&#8221; sobbingly.</p>
<p>They entered the park. Even that was large
enough to get lost in. It grew darker and darker
and there was a sprinkle of rain. Jack held
tight to the man&#8217;s hand, and it seemed as if
the park was full of bears. He was so frightened.
They came to one of the entrances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you keep straight on and you will
come to Arch Street. Good-bye little lad.
It&#8217;s raining quite fast. Hook it along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack <i>did</i> run. Houses began to look familiar.</p>
<p>Yes, here was his own street. Oh, how glad
he was. He almost flew. And his father ran
down the steps and caught his little wet boy
in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack! Jack! Amy,&#8221; he cried through the
open hall door, &#8220;he&#8217;s here! he&#8217;s here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>There had been a great commotion, for Jack
had been instructed to come straight home
from school even if he went out afterward.
And when it came dinnertime with no Jack,
and the dreadful things that one could conjure
up&mdash;being run over, being kidnapped&mdash;for
he was such a pretty little fellow! Mr.
Borden telephoned to the Police Precinct, to
two hospitals, went out to search, inquiring
of the neighboring children. No, he had not
been playing with them. Mrs. Borden was
wild with terror. Aunt Florence said some boy
had coaxed him off somewhere, but she was
desperately afraid that he laid crushed
in some hospital. And now they all hugged
and kissed him; and what with the fatigue,
the fright and all, Jack really had an hysteric.</p>
<p>They rubbed him and put him in some dry
clothes and gave him a dose of aromatic
ammonia to steady his nerves, and then some
supper. And he said he went to the park and
came out somewhere, and a man took him and
two other boys for a ride. Dick was such a
nice, big fellow. He said nothing about hanging
on behind, he had a feeling that wouldn&#8217;t redound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
to the story. And the man took them
out to Roselands and wasn&#8217;t coming back&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roselands,&#8221; cried his mother. &#8220;Oh, Jack
you might have been kidnapped. Never,
never go riding with any strange man. And
how did you get back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We walked some, then another man rode
us a little way, and the boys went off
and I got lost more and more and couldn&#8217;t
find a cop, and asked every so many people,
and a woman gave me a bun and a cake, and
then a man took me across the park and told
me to go straight along. And I was afraid of
the thunder and all, and I was wet, and oh,
dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Jack. You&#8217;re safe home now.
You must come straight home from school,
you have always been told that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he hadn&#8217;t been to school at all!</p>
<p>But he was very sleepy and his mother put
him to bed and kissed him a dozen times. The
scoldings would save until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Jack was rather languid the next morning
and a little afraid. But he was the best boy
in school, and brought home a note from his
teacher, never suspecting his sin would find
him out so soon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>Miss Collins asked his mother if she would
send the reason why Jack was not at school
yesterday afternoon, as they were required to
put it down in the record book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack! You didn&#8217;t go to school yesterday
afternoon! What <i>were</i> you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack hung his head, &#8220;I took a little walk,
and then&mdash;and then&mdash;I was afraid it was late,
and some children were playing&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you naughty boy! That is playing
truant. I don&#8217;t know what your father
will say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to any more. I&#8217;d rather go to
school. It wasn&#8217;t funny a bit. And I don&#8217;t
want to ride in any old wagon that jounces
and jounces, and I did get so tired. What
did the teacher say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have to put the true reason down in
the record book. And there it will stay always.
My nice little boy was a truant-player. And
we shall all be so ashamed. What will your
father say? And he was so afraid last night
that you were killed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mama, I never will do it again, never!&#8221;
Jack hung round his mother&#8217;s neck and cried
and she cried with him, thinking of her tumult
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
of agony last night. And she had him safe&mdash;her
little boy!</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; she began presently, &#8220;can&#8217;t you
be brave enough to tell papa how it began.
Climb up in his lap and tell him how sorry
and ashamed you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he strap me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You deserve it I think. But he surely would
if I told him. And when people do wrong they
must bear the punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I never will do it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him that, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course they talked it over at dinner time.
Jack was not at all vainglorious. Afterward,
he hung around and presently climbed up in
his father&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear little son,&#8221; and his father kissed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But papa, I was badder than all that.&#8221;
Badder seemed to admit more enormity
than simply bad, &#8220;I&mdash;I went in the park to
walk and I staid so long that&mdash;that&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you were ashamed to go back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;&mdash;Jack had spasms of direct truth
tellings now and then, like most children.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel so &#8217;shamed then as when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
teacher spoke of it this afternoon. It looked
so pleasant I thought I&#8217;d go on. Some of the
boys said it was funny to play hookey, but I
don&#8217;t want to do it ever again. And if I had
been killed somewhere!&#8221; Jack began to cry.</p>
<p>The father held him close for some minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;you have been
a very bad boy, and I am glad it wasn&#8217;t a
happy afternoon. I hope you never will
play truant again. Think how mama and I
suffered not knowing what had happened
to you and afraid our little boy might be
brought home dead. You ought to be punished
but you seem to have suffered somewhat,
and I am going to trust you, only, you can&#8217;t
go walking with me on Sunday, and maybe
there are some other pleasures you will
be deprived of. I&#8217;m awfully sorry and mortified
that your name must go on record
down at City Hall as a truant from school.
Some of my friends may see it. These things
are sure to get to daylight and make your
family ashamed of them, and your teachers;
just try to think of that when you do the things
you know are wrong, for even a little boy will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
know that. Didn&#8217;t something tell you
staying from school was wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack crept closer in his father&#8217;s arms. He
was too young for much reasoning, and the
man wondered if he would have been so penitent
if he had had what boys call a real good
time.</p>
<p>They let the matter go at that. Jack looked
very wistful when his father took the babies
out Sunday morning and said no word to him.
He followed Marilla round as she dusted up
the rooms and wanted to know about Bethany
Home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were the children always good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. There were a good many bad ones
among them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they have a strap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a bigger one than your father&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will papa get a bigger one when I&#8217;m big?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, I hope you won&#8217;t need any strap.
Why can&#8217;t you be a good boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack gave a long sigh. &#8220;Sometimes badness
comes into your mind just sudden like.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a pause&mdash;&#8220;Did you like Bethany
Home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as well as being here. I&#8217;ve told you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
that forty times. And there were no little
babies. And no dessert, only a teeny little bit
on Sunday. And just a sweet cracker for tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you like the babies? They
can&#8217;t talk nor do anything. And they are not
as pretty as I am. Folks used to say when I
was real little, &#8216;Oh, what a lovely child.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla laughed, Jack did know that he
was very good looking.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be pretty by and by. And they are
real sweet. I like babies. I like kittens and
little chickens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like a dog. Cats scratch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you torment them. Now I
am going down stairs to put the dishes on the
table. Then I must go and help Bridget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bridget won&#8217;t let me come down in the
kitchen. She chases me out with a stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Children are a bother in the kitchen. They
ask so many questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then his mother and Aunt Florence came
home from church, and his father with both
babies asleep. He carried them upstairs.</p>
<p>Marilla was getting to be quite a handy
table maid for all but the heavy dishes. She
placed them on the dumb waiter and started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
them down stairs. Mrs. Borden took off the
others. When the babies were awake Marilla
had to stay up with them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden dished the cream. &#8220;Jack will
not have any today,&#8221; his mother said.</p>
<p>Jack sat still with his eyes full of tears but
said not a word.</p>
<p>But he went to Sunday school with Marilla
and behaved beautifully.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was always as good as this,&#8221; the
child thought, &#8220;how I should love him.&#8221; He
did not even tease for a walk, a thing she was
quite afraid he would do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>POOR CINDERELLA</h3>
</div>
<p>Oh, how busy they were and the babies took
this opportunity to begin the cutting of teeth.
The auto came for Aunt Hetty. Some of the
parlor furnishings were packed away, everything
swathed in linen. The closing exercises
of the kindergarten took place and Jack distinguished
himself by repeating a pretty little
poem. In September he would be six.</p>
<p>Then came the last week. They would go
on Saturday. Sunday was Fourth of July but
it would be held on Monday. Trunks were
packed, the last bit of shopping done. The
babies fretted and Marilla took them out
morning and afternoon with strict injunctions
to keep on the shady side of the street. It
seemed to grow hotter and hotter. The child
lost her appetite and could not eat Bridget&#8217;s
choice tid-bits. Oh, how her little legs ached,
and her back felt sometimes as if it would
fall apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good you are going,&#8221; declared Bridget.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re almost a skeleton. Goodness knows
I shall miss you enough, and just be thinking
of your coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack had gone down town with his mother
to get some sandals and slippers. She was
very glad, for sometimes his talking almost
set her crazy, and she really was afraid to be
impatient with him.</p>
<p>She had found a beautiful quiet street
with great trees that fairly met in the middle
of it. Many of the families were away. She
sat on one special stoop where the house
was all shut up tight. There were no children
in the street.</p>
<p>It seemed this day, Thursday, as if she would
never get there. The babies were so heavy. She
sat down on the second step, leaning against
the stone column and pushed the carriage
to and fro. Curious shadows went dancing
before her eyes, sometimes she could not
see at all. And she was so sleepy!</p>
<p>Pansy threw her rattle out and cried for
it. Marilla stepped down to pick it up and
fell on the sidewalk. What was the matter
with her legs? they seemed to have lost their
strength. She crawled up again. All the world,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the trees and houses went flying round and
all was dark. She was falling down&mdash;down&mdash;Poor
little Cinderella!</p>
<p>The babies missed the soft soothing voice.
They cried louder and louder, then howled.
Some children came to see what was the matter
two quite big boys among them. The policeman
looked down from the corner and paced
with his slow tread.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the row here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>A lady came down one of the stoops on the
opposite side of the street; a rather tall, slim
woman in a soft gray dress and hat with
violets around the crown. She crossed over.
The policeman had taken the girl by the
shoulder and given her a rough shake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those children howl enough to wake the
dead, and she&#8217;s asleep here.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as he partly raised her Miss Armitage
saw that her face was deadly white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, poor child!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What can be
the matter? And whose babies are these?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re Jack Borden&#8217;s little sisters&mdash;twins.
And thats the nuss gal,&#8221; said one of the big
boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where they live?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Round in Arch street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you take them there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take them,&#8221; rejoined the lady.</p>
<p>The carriage being moved she sat down on
the step and took the girl in her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t dead&mdash;I see the flutter in the
temple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better go to the hospital,&#8221; proposed the
policeman.</p>
<p>Marilla opened her eyes and glanced up
but did not seem to notice anything; then the
lids fell and the beautiful long lashes shadowed
her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carry her to my house across the street,&#8221;
and she led the way.</p>
<p>He picked up the light burden as if it had
been a feather. She opened the door and asked
him to take the child upstairs and lay her on
the couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am obliged to you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In a
way I am in Settlement work. We&#8217;ll have a
doctor and see what is the matter. Then I&#8217;ll
decide about the hospital. And I will find out
about those people.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good sort, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; and he
touched his hat brim to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; she called. &#8220;This poor child isn&#8217;t
exactly in a faint, but something is the matter.
Get a warm bath ready and we&#8217;ll put her in.
I&#8217;ll telephone to Dr. Richards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;he was just going out. Would be up
for a first call.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage undressed her. She was
clean and neat, but the poor little body was
painfully thin. Then they carried her to the
bath. Jane rubbed her softly and she gave
some responsive sighs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pretty lot of little curls and fine
as silk. I do wonder who she can be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the little nurse girl who brings those
babies, twins I suppose they are, and sits on
the stoop over opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well it&#8217;s some sort of a collapse. Now I&#8217;ll
find a nice nightgown, and we&#8217;ll see what the
doctor says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla opened her eyes. They were a
sort of blueish gray, but now very heavy and
dull. Her lips moved, but the tone was very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
low. It sounded as if she said &#8220;fairy godmother&#8221;
and Miss Armitage smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, poor little thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Richards flew around in his auto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought something had happened
to you,&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has,&#8221; and she detailed the simple story.</p>
<p>He followed her up to the room. It was
such a lovely, restful room. A white bed in
the alcove, white window drapery, a carpet
with considerable light blue in it, a dressing
case, a writing desk, some books and pictures,
mostly Madonnas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s been worked
too hard. All her strength seems gone. And
a case of heat prostration. It&#8217;s been an awful
day. Who is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage told over the incident.
&#8220;I have seen her sitting there several times.
It is shady in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two fat babies,&#8221; and he laughed. &#8220;I
should think one would be enough for such
a child to manage. Overwork and underfeeding
I think, and the heat. I&#8217;ll see if I can rouse
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla opened her eyes and the lids
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
seemed to fall from absolute weariness. The
lips moved but made no sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a kind of comatose state. Not knowing
all that is back of it I can&#8217;t quite make
up my mind. If this awful heat would let
up! I&#8217;ll leave some drops to be given to her
and will come in one my first round in the
morning. I haven&#8217;t been to the Settlement
House yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you must go. That little Mary Burns
died at noon, and her mother is half crazy
over it. Poor little thing, deformed and all
that. This child has a nice straight body and
a fine smooth skin. I&#8217;ll go round in Arch
street and see what I can learn about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks worth saving if life really holds
anything for her. Poor things! Why are so
many sent into the world &#8216;just to toil.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going over&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind now. I&#8217;ll attend to it all, and
see the Burns&#8217; priest. Don&#8217;t be worried.
These drops will keep up her strength,&#8221;
nodding to Marilla. &#8220;And I will report in
the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Richards went his way. Miss Armitage
sat and considered. Perhaps it would be as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
well to go to Mrs. Borden&#8217;s. They would be
feeling much alarmed, no doubt. She explained
to Jane and put on her hat again and picked
up her sun umbrella, for some streets were
still in a glow. This was the best part of the
city however, and there were some fine trees.</p>
<p>She stopped and looked in a directory.
There was only one Borden living on Arch
street, a Mr. John Borden, lawyer. She made
a note of the number. Arch street was some
distance farther west, and then only a block
or so. A very nice looking three-story brick
with a stone stoop. She mounted and rang
the bell. There certainly was a child or
children crying.</p>
<p>A young woman much distraught answered
the door. And now positive howls greeted
her ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in such trouble,&#8221; apologized the
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Miss Armitage and live in Loraine
place, nearly opposite where the little girl
fainted. Did the babies get home safely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we are so glad! Won&#8217;t you please
come upstairs for my sister can&#8217;t leave the
children. We have been almost crazy! One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
boy said she fell off the steps. Is she much
hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had a bad fainting spell. The doctor
came and he hardly knows what to think
until tomorrow. The policeman proposed
sending her to the Hospital, but I am one
of the managers of the Settlement House
in Beacon street, so I had her brought over
to my house. A fall, you said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was what a boy said&mdash;that she
tumbled off the step. Oh, Pansy dear, do
hush! You miss Marilla, don&#8217;t you? The best
little nurse in all the world. Oh, what <i>can</i> we
do without her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden was pacing the floor with the
baby&#8217;s head against her shoulder and gently
patting her. She did not scream now, but
sobbed in a very sleepy fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, we are to start on Saturday noon,
and we shall not come back until the middle
of September. We thought it would be so
nice for Marilla, too, she&#8217;d kind of run down
though she wasn&#8217;t at all ill. Bridget worried
that she ate so little and she was growing
thin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long has she been with you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I took her from an institution&mdash;the Bethany
Home&mdash;about the middle of October. She
was just twelve, the Matron said. I think she
was very glad to come. She&#8217;s had a good home
and plenty to eat. And one funny thing is
that Bridget took such a fancy to her, and
though Bridget&#8217;s good as gold, she has some
queer streaks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden sat down and drew a long
breath. Pansy had fallen asleep at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we never let her lift the children or
carry them up and down. I think babies are
sometimes injured for life that way in falling.
They used to sit on the rug and she&#8217;d tell them
stories. I think she must have made them out
of her head&mdash;funny things and she&#8217;d act them
off and the babies would laugh and laugh&mdash;it
was as good as a play. They seemed to
understand every word. Marilla was a born
nurse girl. But what can we do? We must
have someone, and there&#8217;s only such a little
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage was thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I might help you out,&#8221; she said
kindly. &#8220;There is a young girl with us who
worked in a factory until she gave out. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
sent her to the Rest House in the country and
she <i>did</i> improve, but they wouldn&#8217;t take her
back in the factory. She&#8217;s a nice pleasant
girl about seventeen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how good of you to think of it! But
I can&#8217;t pay high wages, for there&#8217;ll be her board
and it won&#8217;t be hard. When the babies are
well they are as good as kittens though they
can&#8217;t scamper around so much. And they&#8217;re
so fat they won&#8217;t walk very soon. It&#8217;ll just
be sitting round and amusing them and looking
after their food. I couldn&#8217;t give more than
three dollars a week&mdash;we are not at all rich,&#8221;
with a short laugh of apology.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Ellen would come for awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I should want Marilla as soon as she
was well enough. You see she&#8217;s bound-out to
me, and we all like her so much. I don&#8217;t see
what <i>could</i> have happened to her. She has
been out in the fresh air most of the time and
we always tell her to go slow with the babies,
not rush along in the heat. What did she say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she hasn&#8217;t spoken at all. She lies just
unconscious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious! Oh, you don&#8217;t think she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
will die?&#8221; and Mrs. Borden really turned pale
with fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;A person sometimes lies that way for
days when overcome with the heat. The
doctor can tell better tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, poor little Marilla! She is so sweet-tempered.
And you were so good not to send
her off to a hospital. How ever should we
have found her! There is so little time. When
shall we hear about this other girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will telephone as soon as I go home and
tell them to send her in the morning,&#8221; and
Miss Armitage rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are so much obliged.&#8221; She followed
her visitor out in the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not come down,&#8221; said Miss Armitage.
&#8220;And I hope the babies will improve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you&mdash;for everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun was going down and some stray
wafts of wind wandered along, which made
the heat rather more endurable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; she said as she walked into the room,
&#8220;did you notice any bruise on the child&#8217;s
head while you were bathing her. She fell off
of the steps it seemed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was none on her forehead. Her hair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
is very thick and I really did not look only to
see that it was in a nice, clean condition. She
hasn&#8217;t suffered for want of cleanliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she told Jane all she had learned,
adding:</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem very nice kind of people. But
oh! those babies!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage telephoned to the settlement
House, stating the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ellen Day was still there and would be
very glad of the position. She would go the
first thing in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane insisted on bringing in a cot and sleeping
beside the little girl who lay quite as still
as if she were dead. Now and then she gave
her the drops and fanned the air about her.
The morning came and the city was astir
again. But it was quiet in Loraine place. So
many had gone away and there were no
trolleys nearby.</p>
<p>They looked over Marilla&#8217;s head and found
one spot above the ear that had a small bit
of discoloration, but it was not in a dangerous
place. The doctor came in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did not think there would be much
change,&#8221; he said. Then he tried to rouse her.
Jane held her up while they gave her a little
milk which she swallowed without difficulty.
She opened her eyes and closed them again,
then lay quiet.</p>
<p>He listened to Miss Armitage&#8217;s interview
and nodded as she went along.</p>
<p>&#8220;The child is terribly run down. I think
she has worked harder than any one imagined.
But they seem to have appreciated her.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one could guess the strain of talking so
incessantly to amuse the babies, of reading to
Jack, of having eyes all over to see that he
did not torment the little ones, push their
playthings out of the way, give them sly
pinches or tweak their hair. She did hate to
tell tales on him. And when he coaxed to
go out with her he was a constant care.
School had been closed for a fortnight. Oh,
how tired she was every night!</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t eat more than a bird,&#8221; Bridget
would complain.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m never hungry now, I shall be so
glad when we get to the real country, and
grass, and everything. I&#8217;m so tired of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
rows and rows of red brick houses, and they
all seem so hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now Bridget was almost heart broken.</p>
<p>Ellen Day came in to tell Miss Armitage
how glad she was that a good word had been
spoken for her. &#8220;And she was sure she should
like the ladies and the pretty little boy. But
how fat the babies were and not a bit pretty.
They were to start at twelve tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was still hot, but in the afternoon it
clouded up and the evening brought a most
refreshing shower. The hot wave was broken.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon they had rolled the couch
over by the window. Miss Armitage sat
reading. Jane had gone out for a walk. The
child seemed to have grown thinner in these
few days.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes slowly and looked intently
at the woman sitting there in her soft,
white attire. She was so sweet and pretty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a fairy godmother?&#8221; Marilla
asked in a weak, wandering tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;A&mdash;what?&#8221; smiling in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fairy godmother. You don&#8217;t look like
the other one, but then it was night and we
went to the King&#8217;s ball. Oh, it was so
splendid!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221; in a soft, persuasive tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a long time ago. I was Cinderella, and
every new Cinderella dances with the Prince,
you know. Only they can&#8217;t dance but once
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was something the child had read,
doubtless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel better?&#8221; she asked tenderly.</p>
<p>Marilla glanced around and sighed. Then
she said in a frightened tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, where am I? And where are the
babies? I heard them cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are all safe and right. And the babies
and all the family went down on Long Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so queer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyelids drooped again and she fell
asleep.</p>
<p>An hour later she woke, and seemed to
study the room and the lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was at fairyland but that once,&#8221;
she said slowly. &#8220;Then there was such lovely
music and dancing and everybody was so
gay. It&#8217;s beautiful here and you are very
sweet. I don&#8217;t know how I came here. Must
I go back?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not until you are well. You have been
ill. And you were brought here&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think. There were the babies. I
went to get something and stumbled and
everything looked so queer, blue and red and
full of stars, and then I went down and down
and all was dark and I kept going down&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fainted and were brought over here.
The babies were taken home. And you have
been ill, but now you are going to get well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been real ill. There were the
measles once in the home and we had to stay
in bed. I was so hungry. Oh, do you know
where Bridget is? She was so good to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is at Mr. Borden&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I please to have a drink?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage brought a glass of milk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like something to eat&mdash;a bit
of custard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hungry. But the milk was good.
Thank you. Who brought me back from that
great dark pit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor, I guess,&#8221; with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I be turned over?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage turned her so her face was
toward the sky. She drew a long breath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind if I should go to sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, and I&#8217;ll read to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sweet voice soon lulled her to sleep.
And she did not speak again all through the
evening, but was rather restless all night.
No one had to watch with her now, but Miss
Armitage was troubled at the soft, long sighs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE FAIRY GODMOTHER</h3>
</div>
<p>Marilla wondered what the bells were
ringing for. And then pistols were firing. Oh,
yes, it was Fourth of July. She would get
up&mdash;but her thin legs gave way and her head
spun round. All the room was strange, and
everybody seemed mixed up. Then a soft
voice said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you are better this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel&mdash;queer&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The face was flushed, the little hands were
hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor was afraid of fever,&#8221; Miss
Armitage said to Jane, &#8220;and it has come.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the doctor was in early. There would
be so many calls on him, by and by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is fever. She seemed better yesterday.
And she can&#8217;t spare any strength to
be burned up, so we must do our best. I don&#8217;t
dare treat her as you would a robust child, but
I&#8217;ll give her something every hour, and get
in again before night. Oh, no, I think it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
hardly critical,&#8221; in answer to the lady&#8217;s
anxious look.</p>
<p>Marilla did not seem to know any one.
She muttered little catches of talk about the
babies and Jack, always pleading with him
not to do this or that. Once she laughed and
waved her hand to and fro as if in response to
music and said&mdash;&#8220;All the Cinderellas! How
beautiful!&#8221;</p>
<p>A tall, plain-looking Irish woman came in
at midafternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her it&#8217;s Bridget,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I
see her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied Miss Armitage, &#8220;But I
am afraid she will not recognize you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she led the way upstairs. Marilla lay
on the cot now and was moving her hands as if
acting something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the dear!&#8221; Bridget knelt down by the
side of the bed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember Bridget
whose come to care for you so much? Ah
dear! It&#8217;s meself that sorry enough to see ye
lyin&#8217; this way, thin as a ghost.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened her eyes, &#8220;Bridget! Oh, you
know the night I went to the ball and fairy
godmother turned my old frock into the beautifullest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
frock, all lace and ribbons. And I
danced with the Prince and had such a lovely
time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the eyelids fell and she lapsed into
unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage glanced inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was along of a dream that she had once;
it <i>was</i> a dream for such things don&#8217;t happen
now-a-days, more&#8217;s the pity. But she always
believes it real and true, the dear, that she
was Cinderella, and had been there. She&#8217;s
the best little thing I ever saw, and she never
told you a lie or took a bit of cake without
asking. In the beginning she must have belonged
to some nice folks; and just look at her
pretty hands and feet, light and small enough
to dance at any king&#8217;s ball. But it&#8217;s hard on
the nice ones that have to go to Homes and
be put out for little drudges. Though they&#8217;re
nice people, the Bordens, as you may guess by
my stayin&#8217; with &#8217;em goin&#8217; on five year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she wasn&#8217;t over-worked,&#8221; ventured
Miss Armitage. &#8220;She is so thin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been falling away dreadful the last
month. Well, she wasn&#8217;t and she was. There
was an old lady living up on the third floor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
an aunt or something and she was afraid of
bad spells, she did have some, and she&#8217;d
ring her bell for Marilla an&#8217; it would be upstairs
an&#8217; down, sometimes way down to my
kitchen, and lugging those two fat babies
up and down the street&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she have to carry them any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. The mistress didn&#8217;t want her to
lift them. She was afraid of a fall and their
backs would get broken. So when they were
big enough they sat on the floor and she talked
to them and told them funny things and
acted &#8217;em off and laughed, and they&#8217;d laugh
too. It was like a play to see &#8217;em. And they&#8217;d
jabber back and she&#8217;d make b&#8217;lieve she understood
it all. She was a wonderful child&#8217;s
nurse an&#8217; there&#8217;ll be trouble enough without
her. But the babies went to bed early an&#8217; then
she&#8217;d come down an&#8217; wipe the dishes for me
an&#8217; they made no call on her. But Jack was
a holy terror, he was that bad, but he went
to school in the spring. If he was mine I&#8217;d
skin him alive. But it was hard dragging them
fat, heavy things around. Will you tell me
just how you come to find her? They&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
missed her so. They screech enough to raise
the dead, an&#8217; I know it&#8217;s for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage told the incident over.</p>
<p>&#8220;The saints bless and protect you ma&#8217;am
for not lettin&#8217; her be sent to a hospital! But
do you think she <i>can</i> get well? And if that
other maid suits, couldn&#8217;t you keep her here
all summer and let her get good and strong?
I&#8217;m going out to my cousin at Fairfield to
stay until next Monday. The boss will be
down with his folks until then, and all the
vallerbles have been sent out of the house so
we can leave it alone. And when I come back
we may have a plan for the poor dear that
isn&#8217;t baby tendin&#8217;. O the little darlin&#8217;! Don&#8217;t
let her die, ma&#8217;am, she&#8217;s so nice and sweet!&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught the little hand and kissed it,
and winked away the tears that glistened in
her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, you may be sure. And when
you come back, I shall be glad to have a call
from you. And by that time she may know
us all. Thank you for your sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bridget nodded and turned away. Miss
Armitage studied the little girl with a new
interest. She had seen beautiful children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
among the very poor, in the slums, with
no ancestry back of them. There was something
about this child&mdash;not beauty either, that
set one to thinking. She must learn something
about her.</p>
<p>And then she smiled over the fancy of
being Cinderella and dancing with the Prince
at the ball. What a happy dream it must
have been for the child! She was glad to hear
that she had not been badly treated or ill
fed. She could trust the kindly Bridget for
that.</p>
<p>When the doctor came in Sunday morning
a smile lighted up his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;A real improvement,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;No
fever and a normal temperature. Pulse
stronger. Now, with nourishing diet and some
salt in the baths we shall have her about
again, though I&#8217;ve had several patients lie
weeks in this state in the hot weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla glanced up and smiled back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I feel all well,&#8221; she began. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
I get up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Armitage. &#8220;Jane will you
bring that small pink kimona and put it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the doctor over in the bay window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Borden&#8217;s cook came in to see the
child. She seemed very fond of her and said
she was the sweetest little thing. And that
she was wonderful with the babies. I was glad
she had not been &#8216;put upon&#8217; as they say
over to the house. And that she always
had enough to eat. And she wasn&#8217;t allowed
to lift the babies&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But dragged them about in the carriage.
Such children are not strong enough for nursemaids.
She was pretty well used up, and she&#8217;ll
be sometime getting over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a curious fancy to the child.
Jane thinks she must have belonged to what
we call &#8216;nice people.&#8217; She flattered me by
asking, the first coherent words she uttered if
I was not &#8216;a fairy godmother?&#8217; Think of
that!&#8221; smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, <i>I</i> think you have been that many a
time. I wonder you haven&#8217;t filled the house
with children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always full of pity for them. But
when they are cured and put in some place
where they can do their best, and have a
little love and care, I go on to the next. I
do not believe I am a real missionary, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
have a theory&mdash;it may not be a very noble
one,&#8221; and a soft color suffused her fine face,
&#8220;that people who bring children into the world
ought to be made to feel the responsibility
of them and not shift them on society at large,
trusting Providence to take care of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what ought to be taught&mdash;the
responsibility of children. Women as well as
men sin in this respect. The woman who forgives
the drunken husband and takes him
back until tired of working he goes off again
leaving another child to add to the poorly-fed
throng she can hardly take care of. I
think the man who goes off the second time,
or who does not take care of the children he
has, should be put in some institution and
made to earn their support. And the girls
ought to be educated up to better ideas of
marriage. It doesn&#8217;t near always conduce to
morality. I preach sermons to you&mdash;don&#8217;t I?&#8221;
and he gave a short laugh. &#8220;And we can never
set the world straight. But these Homes and
Republics are doing a good work in training
children to self reliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane wrapped the little girl in the kimona and
lifted her up in the reclining chair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s so nice. How good you are!
And everything is so lovely. Oh, I&#8217;ll soon be
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the little face clouded over. Oh, she
truly would not mind being ill if she could
stay in this beautiful house where everything
was so quiet. Jane went in and out, and presently
she brought a cup of broth. How good
it tasted!</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind if I went back to bed?
I&#8217;m so sleepy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; returned Jane, and she put her
gently back on the cot where she soon fell
asleep.</p>
<p>There was slight rise of fever and restlessness
about noon. She talked in broken
snatches imploring Jack not to do this or that
and not to pinch the babies. Then she was
so tired, so tired! But about midafternoon,
she seemed to rouse and come to herself and
said she was hungry. There was broth and
hot milk and some stewed fruit, and Jane
brushed her hair that fell in a bed of rings
and asked if she didn&#8217;t want to sit up. She
brought her over by the window so she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
look out, but the back yard was very pretty
for it was gay with blooming flowers.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage had been to church, and at
two she had a class of young girls who were
clerks in stores. Half of them were going away
on Monday to the Rest House for a week, and
they were full of that. Two of them had never
been before. Was it like Coney Island?</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not far from the shore, the broad Sound
that leads out to the ocean. But there are
not side shows. Just rowing and bathing, and
a ride every day in a big omnibus. And plenty
of girls. Oh, you won&#8217;t be lonesome;&#8221; and
Miss Armitage smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another girl and I went away last summer
to a house that wasn&#8217;t country but a
beautiful street with lawns in front. There
were three ladies, and oh, they were so particular.
They did not have any story papers
and the books were all dull and religious and
if you took up one you must put it back in
the same place. They didn&#8217;t like us to talk
&#8216;store&#8217; nor sing any street songs and one lady
only played hymns on the piano. Oh, we <i>were</i>
so homesick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Rest House has a big farm and chickens
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
and two cows, and a tennis court and croquet.
And there are lovely walks. And
hammocks and swings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket!&#8221; said one of the girls.
&#8220;You want some fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage did not check her. She
thought of the amusements and pleasures of
her youth. Then she came home to her
little girl whose face lighted up with gladness,
and who put out her thin hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look lovely,&#8221; Marilla said. &#8220;And
I&#8217;m getting almost well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good news,&#8221; and the lady smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only it seems so queer when I try to think.
It is such a long while. I seem to have been
lost and couldn&#8217;t find my way out. Do you
know where the babies are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They all went down to Long Island. I
sent them a new girl. And Bridget was here
to inquire about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she was so good to me. I was a little
afraid of her at first, especially when she said
she&#8217;d &#8216;skin me alive.&#8217; Don&#8217;t you think it
would hurt dreadfully? She used to threaten
Jack, but she never did it. And she said that
about the fairy godmother and the King&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
ball was a dream. What is it that goes to
strange places when you are asleep? And
how can you enjoy and remember all, and
hear the music for days afterward? If there
are two lives, one for day and one for night,
why doesn&#8217;t the night one go straight on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to ask the doctor these
curious puzzles. They are beyond me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Bridget at the house?&#8221; she inquired
after a moment&#8217;s thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was going away to some cousin to
stay a week as Mr. Borden will be down to&mdash;Bayside,
I think it is, all the week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get well I suppose I shall have to go
back to the babies. You know I am a bound
out girl&mdash;until I am eighteen. But they&#8217;ll
be growing bigger all the time. I wish they
were as pretty as Jack. Don&#8217;t you think all
babies ought to be pretty? And have curly
hair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the curly hair quite an addition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another puzzle. Why should
some hair curl and some hair keep straight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But your&#8217;s is curly,&#8221;
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I like it. At the Home there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
two other girls with curly hair. And the
nurse said it made us vain, so she cut it close
to the skin and she said it wouldn&#8217;t curl
any more. That was last summer. But it
did when it grew out, and I was glad. I tried
to make the babies curl, and Mrs. Borden
said she&#8217;d give me a silver dollar if I could.
But it was <i>so</i> straight and there wasn&#8217;t much
of it. Do you remember the fat little girl of
the Campbell&#8217;s Soups? The babies look a
good deal like her. They have high foreheads
and round eyes full of wonder, and
such chubby cheeks. But Aunt Florence
said Mr. Borden was just such a baby and
he isn&#8217;t at all chubby now and has dark
eyes. Jack&#8217;s are dark. Maybe they&#8217;ll grow
prettier. But they&#8217;re good and&mdash;funny.
They laugh over everything, and they seem
to understand everything I say or read to
them. I wonder if they will like the new
girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is very pleased and, I think, patient&mdash;four
years older than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, suppose they didn&#8217;t want me back?&#8221;
and the child drew a long breath of half
fear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There will be something else,&#8221; in an assuring
tone.</p>
<p>Marilla leaned her head back on the pillow.
She had talked herself tired. How queer
that was, too, when she had talked for hours
to the babies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like me to read to you?&#8221;
inquired Miss Armitage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, if it&#8217;s verses. There&#8217;s a curious
music in verses that goes all through you,
keeping time to something in your brain. I
just love them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lady found &#8220;Songs of Seven&#8221; with its
musical lilt and the child listened wide-eyed
as if it made pictures to her. Then the doctor
came in and was very much pleased over her
improvement.</p>
<p>But the next day she was quite languid
again. She took a few steps when suddenly
everything swam before her eyes and she
would have fallen but for Jane&#8217;s strong arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t suppose I can never walk
any more?&#8221; she cried in affright. &#8220;For
there was a nurse at the Home who fell down
that way and she had been very well, too.
But something happened to her hips. I can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
think what they called it, and she never could
walk again. They had to send her to the
hospital and she could get about just a little
on crutches. Oh, dear&#8221; and Marilla began to
cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There don&#8217;t think of such a thing. It was
only weakness,&#8221; comforted Miss Armitage.
&#8220;Once when I was ill I fainted a great many
times for just nothing at all. You have
not had a chance to get strong yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla recalled seeing the nurse brought
down stairs on a stretcher, they called it. And
the doctor said she could never walk again.
Oh, how dreadful that would be. She turned
her face over on the pillow and let the tears
drop silently, and she could not swallow any
supper, something lay so heavy on her breast.
Miss Armitage kissed her, and Marilla twined
her arms around the soft white neck hardly
hidden by the lace. There had never been
any one to love during the later years. And
her mother had been busy and away in a store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, dear,&#8221; said the soothing voice.
&#8220;God takes care of us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun was shining the next morning and
the next door canary hanging out on the back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
porch was singing with all his might and
main. Such long sweet warbles, such a merry
staccato with little pauses, as if he asked&mdash;&#8220;Now,
what do you think of that?&#8221; and the
child laughed with a sense of glee. Oh, how
nice it would be to be a bird. But she wouldn&#8217;t
want to live in a cage <i>all</i> the time.</p>
<p>Jane came and gave her a bath, rubbed her
softly but thoroughly across the hips and up
and down the spine, holding her up with one
strong arm. Marilla took a frightened step,
then another and laughingly flung her arms
around Jane&#8217;s neck, crying&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can walk! I can walk!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you think you could never walk
again?&#8221; Jane laughed wholesomely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt so queer&mdash;and I thought of the woman
at the Home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she must have been quite an old
body. They do get paralyzed; children don&#8217;t.
Oh, you must not think of dreadful things.
Come, see how you can walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane&#8217;s arm was around her and she led her
back to the room and dressed her. Miss
Armitage came up just then and greeted her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
with a happy smile. But Marilla felt shaky
and was very glad to sit down on the couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I shall bring you up some breakfast,&#8221;
said Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose I could go down and
have some real breakfast at the table&mdash;not
today, but sometime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Marilla flushed. She was a bound-out
girl and had always taken her meals with
Bridget.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so. We will see what the
doctor says this morning. I shall have to
go out presently and see twenty girls get
started for a vacation. They are in stores
and factories, and have two weeks in the summer,
and the Rest House doesn&#8217;t charge any
board&mdash;they earn so little. When you are
well enough to travel about, I must take you
out to the House.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe she wouldn&#8217;t have to go back to the
babies right away!</p>
<p>The breakfast tasted good, though it was
only a poached egg and some toast. But
she didn&#8217;t seem very hungry, and though she
felt sort of joyously well at heart her body
was tired and she lay on the couch to rest. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
doctor found her quiet and there was a
whimsical light playing over his face and
settling in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you haven&#8217;t run away yet?&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I could run very far. Yet
I seem quite well&mdash;and it&#8217;s queer, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane said you fainted yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well it was&mdash;something, and then I was
frightened&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand up a moment.&#8221; He helped her to
her feet, then he passed his hand down her
spine and over her hips. &#8220;Does it hurt any?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not a real hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fell off of the stoop over there, a boy
said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The baby dropped something and I went
to pick it up, I guess I stumbled. And when
I turned round everything was upside down
and black and I don&#8217;t remember any more
until I was over here. Miss Armitage was so
good, is so good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; well it might have been worse. But
I think now you are on the high road to health
again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been real sick unless this is it,&#8221;
and she gave a vague smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is,&#8221; nodding humorously. &#8220;The
babies have been rather too much for you
this hot weather. Were you very fond of
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they were not bad and very funny.
You can&#8217;t love bad people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t,&#8221; with an emphasis. &#8220;You
may like them and think they&#8217;re pretty and
sweet sometimes, but you don&#8217;t truly love
them I mean you wouldn&#8217;t choose them if
you had you choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which you don&#8217;t often have in this world.
Now what would be your choice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d like to stay here. I don&#8217;t know
what I&#8217;d do if I was Miss Armitage&#8217;s bound-out
girl. Jane does everything and&mdash;cook
does the meals. She might let me wipe the
dishes. But&mdash;maybe you don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m
bound-out to Mrs. Borden until I&#8217;m eighteen,
so I shall have to go back. And the babies
need me. I&#8217;m teaching them to talk. I&#8217;m
almost Cinderella, not the kitchen kind,
though I wouldn&#8217;t mind that with Bridget.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you went to the King&#8217;s ball with
a fairy godmother. Would you mind telling
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla colored. Yes, she would be quite
pretty if she wasn&#8217;t so thin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why it was just a dream. And I was
asleep by the kitchen stove. I hadn&#8217;t any
belief in her at first. Oh, do you know anything
about that curious part of your brain
that dreams?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not. I think no one really does.
I suppose you had been reading about Cinderella.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to read it over to the babies, or tell
them. But there was Red Riding Hood and
Jack and the Beanstalk and Hop o&#8217; My
Thumb. Jack had them all, but I never
dreamed of them. And the babies seemed to
understand them all. They laughed at the
funny places and they looked so shocked at
the dreadful things, and were so pleased when
the old wolf fell down the chimney, dead.
Why it was just delightful to me, only sometimes
I did get tired talking so much and had
to wait for my breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you tired now?&#8221; and he listened a
moment to her heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. I feel all good and rested, and
Jane said I ate a nice breakfast. I&#8217;m almost
well, though I wouldn&#8217;t mind being ill a long,
long while if I could stay here. There was a
little girl once who died and went to heaven.
Miss Florence had the book. That wasn&#8217;t any
fairy story, and I think this must be a good
deal like heaven. It&#8217;s so quiet with no one
troubling you, and when Miss Armitage
plays&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her soft eyes were like wind-blown lakes and
the far-away sight moved him inexpressibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell me about the dream?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll only laugh at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t laugh. I never knew a Cinderella
who went to the palace and danced
with the King&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her up a little in the bed and placed
the pillows around her. Then he seated himself
on the couch at her feet and smiled so
persuasively that she really couldn&#8217;t resist.
She pictured the kitchen and how comfortably
she had settled herself and&mdash;she really couldn&#8217;t
have been asleep she saw everything so plainly
and, at first, she did not believe the fairy
godmother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>Dr. Richards was really charmed as she
went on. It was all so vivid, so beautiful.
She appeared to have a better command of
language than most children of her years,
and the whole picture was exquisite. Why,
it seemed very real to him. And her face
was a study. Surely the child must be a
genius, she made the things so real and not
overdrawn. A veritable fairy palace.</p>
<p>Then she drew a long breath and a lovely
smile irradiated her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I went,&#8221; she said in a satisfied
tone, freighted with a certain joyousness
that appealed to his heart. She really was
transfigured at that moment. What possibilities
were lying in her soul unawakened.
The little bound-out girl would never, could
never realize them alone in her fight with life.
For he had known:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Full many a flower is born to blush unseen<br />
And waste its sweetness on the desert, air.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>When a helping hand would have transplanted
it into a garden of appreciation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>A sudden fatherhood stirred within him.
He had thought more than once of the woman
he would like for his wife; now he wanted this
little girl to grow up by his side and bloom
with the sacred joy within her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, too,&#8221; he said in a strange, full
voice that trembled with emotion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>DOCTOR RICHARDS</h3>
</div>
<p>Doctor Richards went slowly down stairs,
Miss Armitage let herself in with her latch
key.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is my little patient today?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stronger in some respects. But I don&#8217;t
quite like the heart action. And I&#8217;m afraid
I haven&#8217;t improved it any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you did not scold her&mdash;?&#8221; in a half
upbraiding tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. But I coaxed that dream story
out of her and several other things. In a year
or two more those Borden babies will have her
all worn out. So many of the little Cinderellas
don&#8217;t get half a chance with life, the
stolid ones do better. But she could hold an
audience with that story, if she was not
afraid of the audience,&#8221; smiling a little, &#8220;and
the lovely expressions that flit over her face!
She is not the usual child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a little afraid to think that. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
many of the child prodigies flatten out and
make ordinary people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And some of them never get the true
opportunity. I&#8217;ve a boy under my observation
who is going to make a first-class surgeon,
and I&#8217;m persuading a man to educate
him. His father is going to put him in a
foundry. Think of hands fitted for the nicest
surgery being coarsened by contact with rough
iron and hard tools. He would lose the fine
touch by hard manual labor if he worked for
his education. No one knows all the children
sacrificed to Moloch. But the little girl!
Of course she thinks of going back. She isn&#8217;t
even tugging at the chain. But I, for one,
don&#8217;t believe God puts people in just the place
He wants them to stay, when He must see
that they can&#8217;t work out. Well&mdash;did you
get the girls off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and they were a delighted lot. Three
only are to have their wages paid. Yet an
employer told me about a week ago he had
subscribed twenty-five dollars to one of these
girls&#8217; summer homes. That at four dollars
a week would have paid six girl&#8217;s a week&#8217;s
wages. His name goes down on the generous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
list of course. Oh, I don&#8217;t wonder people
like to do the things that show! The things
that only God can know do not come up for
credit. But it is &#8216;deal justly&#8217; first of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to stay and talk&mdash;but there is a
serious matter before me. Take good care
of our little girl&mdash;but I needn&#8217;t charge <i>you</i>.
I&#8217;ll be in again tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage went slowly upstairs, paused
a few moments at her desk to jot down some
items. When she went through to the next
room, Marilla was asleep. The little face was
framed in with rings of shining hair, the lips
were palely pink and parted with a half smile,
the skin still showed blue veins. With a
little care, such as rich people gave their
children, she might grow up pretty, she would
always be sweet. And the pudgy babies with
their wondering eyes loved her!</p>
<p>Marilla improved slowly but surely. She
walked from room to room, and one day she
went down stairs to luncheon. Just the small
round table in the recess by the side window
set out with all manner of pretty dishes and
a pretty glass basket of flowers in the center.
And there was Jane to wait upon them, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
she seemed so pleased to have Marilla down
stairs though the little girl had held tight to
the bannister, lest she should lose her balance
and fall. Everything looked so cool and
sweet. The pictures were of woods and lakes,
or a bit of sedgy river. There were fine
sheer draperies at the windows, a tall vase
of flowers on the beautiful centerpiece that
adorned the real dining table.</p>
<p>Oh, how good the delicate asparagus soup
tasted. And the cold chicken, the rice and
the dainty potato cake. Marilla was all
smiles inside, she could feel the quiver. She
had not been waited on this way since the
night in fairy land. Bridget had a way of
shoving things toward you or asking you to
get up and help yourself. But then, Bridget
had done the cooking and was tired, and
Marilla was glad to wait on her.</p>
<p>After the dessert, they went through to the
drawing room and that looked lovely to the
little girl. There was a portfolio of engravings
on a sort of stand, and you could sit
there and turn them over without any effort.
There were so many pretty children among
them, and some of royal families that were
to be kings and queens.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>The postman came and Jane brought in a
handful of letters. Miss Armitage looked
them over casually. Here was one from
Bayside and she opened it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Armitage,&#8221; it began.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we can thank you for
taking Marilla in as you did, and by this time
I hope she is about well. Mr. Borden comes
up on Saturday morning to see a client and
will call for Marilla at about two. We
simply can&#8217;t do without her. We&#8217;ve had the
most awful time! Two babies getting four
teeth apiece are enough to drive one crazy.
There was no trouble about the other teeth,
but I think it would not have been so bad if
we&#8217;d had Marilla. They have missed her
and cried after her and no one could get them
asleep until they were fairly worn out and
then they sobbed in the most heartbreaking
way. We&#8217;ve had no rest day or night. Ellen
is very good and patient, but the babies
simply won&#8217;t let her touch them. Marilla
always knew just what to do. She was so
entertaining. She certainly was born for a
nurse girl, though I thought she was most too
young when I took her, I&#8217;ve never let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
her lift them, for they&#8217;re like a lump of lead.
They have grown thinner and I do hope it
will keep on, unless Marilla makes them laugh
so much they fat up again. They have each
cut two teeth and they had to be lanced.
Sister and I have had an awful time. We
shall be so glad to get Marilla back. I think
Ellen will not be a success as a child&#8217;s nurse.
And I can get her a first-class place as a parlor
maid where she can have eighteen dollars
a month, which I couldn&#8217;t afford to pay.
There is a cook and a laundress kept, so she
won&#8217;t lose by coming down. She is very nice,
pleasant and tidy, and we had to have some
one in the emergency. And poor little Marilla
must have gone to a hospital but for your
kindness. We are all so obliged and if Mr.
Borden can be of service to you, sometime,
he will be very glad. These are the favors
money cannot repay.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if you will have Marilla ready about two
o&#8217;clock on Saturday, Mr. Borden will call for
her. If she needs a dress will you kindly
purchase it and tell him. We have all her
clothes down here. There is a beautiful big
lawn with hammocks and everything, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
if she is not very strong yet she can have sea
bathing which is splendid, and fine diet.
And we certainly are your deeply grateful
friends. </p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:right'>&#8220;Mrs. Mary Borden.&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>Miss Armitage read the letter over twice
and watched the pale little girl enjoying the
pictures. It was not quite a heartless letter
but, it had no special sympathy for the poor
little Cinderella, if she did not have to sit
in the ashes. Then she laid it by and went
at the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please Miss Armitage, may I go upstairs?
I am so tired. What do you suppose makes
me feel tired so easily?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not strong yet. Yes, we will go
upstairs and you must lie down.&#8221;</p>
<p>She placed her arm around the slender body.
Marilla kissed the white hand.</p>
<p>The doctor came in the next morning, and
Miss Armitage handed him the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the average woman any soul!&#8221; he
exclaimed angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Borden has had no means of knowing
how severe the case really was&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, she might have written on&mdash;say
Tuesday and inquired. Why Marilla might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
have died with just a little more. She doesn&#8217;t
go. She won&#8217;t be strong enough to bother
with teething babies in some time yet, if at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t think&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a weak heart. It may have come
from the shock and there is time enough for
her to outgrow it, with care. Are you going
to tire of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw there was no doubt in his face and
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla&#8217;s no more trouble than a kitten.
Jane is positively in love with her. I&#8217;m not
sure but I shall ask to have her transferred
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hilda Armitage you ought to be the mother
of girls. I don&#8217;t know about the boys,&#8221; with
a doubtful laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had two disappointments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you that Conklin girl was not worth
the trouble. She&#8217;s singing in a vaudeville
show and it <i>does</i> suit her. You couldn&#8217;t get
any refined ambition in that vain and silly
brain. It is casting pearls before swine. Save
the pearls for some one worthy. <i>She</i> doesn&#8217;t
go back to the Borden&#8217;s this summer. When
you get tired of her&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we quarrel about her?&#8221; She glanced
up with an odd, humorous smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we shall in the end, but that is a
good way off. When that man comes today,
just let him see Marilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Borden came punctually at two and
was quite profuse in his thanks for Miss
Armitage&#8217;s kindness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I regret to say that Marilla has progressed
very slowly. She had quite an exhausting
fever at first. She was not able to come downstairs
until yesterday, and lies down several
times through the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible! Why we thought&mdash;and we
need her so much! Did you&mdash;&#8221; he flushed
a little, &#8220;have a good physician?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An excellent one whose practice is mostly
among children. He thought her quite worn
out, but it was being overcome with the heat
and she fell off the steps. It was near congestion
of the brain I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry. We were so busy just
then, and my wife was worried to death.
The babies had always been so good, but I
can&#8217;t imagine anything being so&mdash;so dreadful
as they&#8217;ve been for a week. I&#8217;ve scarcely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
slept an hour at a time and Mrs. Borden is
clear worn out. She thinks just the sight
of Marilla would comfort them. We might
go on keeping that Ellen, though the babies
won&#8217;t take to her. I think Marilla charmed
them; but they&#8217;re always been good until
now. And there&#8217;s four more teeth to come
through,&#8221; in a despairing sort of tone.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage had large sympathy and she
felt really sorry for him. Yet how providential
that Marilla had missed the care!</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had a very bad time, certainly,
and it is fortunate that Marilla didn&#8217;t give
out on your hands. Would you like to see
her, though I think she is asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;oh yes. If we kept Ellen, don&#8217;t
you think she might come down next week.
The sea-bathing would no doubt strengthen
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has some heart weakness. I&#8217;m afraid
she couldn&#8217;t stand the bathing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she rose and led the way up stairs.</p>
<p>Marilla was asleep. Mr. Borden studied
her in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, she&#8217;s grown dreadfully thin. Yes,
she must have been very ill, but like the babies,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
she&#8217;d always been well. I&#8217;m awful sorry. I
don&#8217;t know what we shall do. Mrs. Borden
had counted so on her coming. And she said
over half a dozen times that I must not forget
to thank you for all this kindness. You
must send me the doctor&#8217;s bill. She&#8217;s such a
nice child, Miss Armitage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla stirred and opened her eyes, closed
them sighed and opened them again, then
half murmured&mdash;&#8220;Oh, doctor,&#8221; and started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla, child, don&#8217;t you remember Mr.
Borden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had not told her about your coming.
We keep her as tranquil as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Borden!&#8221; Marilla sat up. &#8220;And
the babies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The babies are in a very poor way, Marilla.
They certainly are homesick for you.
We try to keep them comforted with the
promise of you. Oh, I hoped you would be
well enough to go down with me this afternoon.
Their mother will be telling them you
will surely come. Poor little girl, but you
are going to get well, aren&#8217;t you? And Jack
thinks there&#8217;s no fun without you, and no
one to read to him or tell him stories.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>The child gave a vague smile. She was
very glad to be away from Jack; indeed, sick
babies did not appear attractive to her just
now, but she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m very sorry. The doctor said it
was the heat and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was awfully hot that week. That made
the babies worse. Oh, if I could take you
down just to amuse them. You made them
laugh so, Marilla. You know just how to do
it. Well&mdash;it can&#8217;t be helped, but you must
try to get well and have some good of the
pretty country place. Is there anything I
can do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Armitage is so good. And Jane and
the doctor. And the yard is full of flowers.
I&#8217;m very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so. Maybe you won&#8217;t want to
come back. But you belong to us, you know
and we can&#8217;t give you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he turned to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you kiss the babies for me and tell
them how sorry I am, and ask Jack not to
tease them, and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221; she swallowed over
a great lump in her throat&mdash;&#8220;I shall come back
when I get well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good girl. Good-bye. I shall
be in town next week and will come in and
see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave the little hand a clasp. Miss
Armitage went down with him. Marilla
turned her face over on the pillow and cried
as if her heart would break. Could she go
back to the babies and Jack? And Bridget
wasn&#8217;t as sweet as Jane, and there was sharp
Aunt Hetty&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear! My dear!&#8221; said the soft voice
with its infinite pity, and the sweet lips kissed
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Armitage, won&#8217;t God take you to
heaven if you pray very hard? I should hate
to leave you and the dear, nice doctor, but
I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t want to go back to the babies
and Jack. I&#8217;m tired of them, and I feel as
if it was foolish to be funny when there are
so many sweet things to think of and books
to read and your beautiful music. But I
must go away from all that, and somehow
heaven looks nicer. And when you die
doesn&#8217;t an angel come and take you in his
arms and just carry you up and up to the
other side of the sky where everything is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
peace and loveliness, and no one will torment
you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my child, perhaps God wants you to
live here a little longer and do some work for
him. The doctor would be very sorry not
to have you get well. Some one might say&mdash;&#8216;He
let that little girl die when he might have
saved her,&#8217; but they wouldn&#8217;t know it was
because she kept brooding over it all the time
and would make no effort to get well. God
knows what is best for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mind about going back. But today
it seemed to be&mdash;dreadful,&#8221; with a convulsive
sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we have spoiled you. Oh, I am
sorry for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear Miss Armitage, don&#8217;t be sorry
when you have been so good. But I don&#8217;t
quite understand how anyone can bind you
out and make you stay years if you didn&#8217;t
want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But children do not know what is best for
them. Some go wandering round the streets
without any home and are picked up and put
in a place almost like a prison where they have
to work whether they like it or not. And some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
even have cruel fathers and mothers. You
said the Bordens were good to you. Would
you rather be there or at the Home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d rather be there than at the Home,
but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; and she swallowed hard over a sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they worked you beyond reason or half
starved you a complaint could be made but
they all seem to love you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage smiled with a soft kind of
sadness, as if she wished the truth were not
quite so true, and the things that looked
so delightful were not so often the thing it
was best to give up for honor&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they do love me, babies and all, and
of course I must go back when I am well
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she turned her face away and tried to
keep back the tears. Jane entered at that
moment and the tension was broken.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage read verses to her after she
was in bed that evening, and kissed her good
night with motherly tenderness. Then she
sat for some time and thought.</p>
<p>Why should she have taken a fancy to this
little girl? She had seen prettier children who
were homeless and helped provide for them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
The Bordens were not rough or heartless.
Bridget had spoken well of them. The child
had a comfortable home, and she was bound
in honor. It would be mean to entice her
to break the bargain, to make her dissatisfied.
No, she must not do that.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage&#8217;s life lines had run along
smoothly through girlhood. Her mother
was a widow and they had a comfortable
income. Hilda had a good voice and sang
in church, gave some music lessons. There
had been a lover and a dear friend and the
old tragedy had occurred, that might have
been more heartbreaking if her mother had
not been taken ill. For days her recovery was
doubtful. Then an uncle at Los Angeles
besought her to come out to that genial clime
and spend her remaining days with him, for
now he was quite alone.</p>
<p>Hilda made all preparations. Such of the
furniture as had intrinsic value was to be
stored with a friend, the rest sold. And then
Mrs. Armitage had an unlooked for relapse
and Hilda went out alone.</p>
<p>Her uncle was a kindly man past middle
life and he took an instant fancy to Hilda.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
The house and its surroundings were loveliness
itself. Life here would be really enchanting.
It was such a beautiful world.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have not seen half of it yet.
Hilda, what would you say to going abroad?
I&#8217;ve wanted to half my life. But my wife,
as you have heard, was an invalid and not
inclined to travel. We lost our two children.
I&#8217;m not too old to start out now and view
some things with the eyes of an enthusiastic
young girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>So abroad they went. She had seven years
of the richness of the old world, learning
languages, listening to music that stirred
every pulse of her soul, haunting art galleries
with loving companionship that somehow
saw the best and most beautiful in everything
if it was not always high art.</p>
<p>And then she returned alone. It seemed
more of a loss than the death of her mother.
She remained awhile in California settling
up some business and then the longing seized
her to return to the home of her youth, to have
a real home where she could make the center
she was still dreaming of, surround herself
with friends and do something worth while
with her money.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Newton had changed as well, enlarged its
boundaries and made itself beautiful at the
northern end. The shops and factories were
kept down by the railroad center where
two important lines crossed, and the river
was navigable. Then Main Street was devoted
to really fine stores, Brandon to offices
and men&#8217;s businesses, the Postoffice being
there. A handsome library building adorned
Broadway, there were Orphan Homes, an
Old Ladies&#8217; Home, a Social Settlement.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage liked the aspect of it.
Boarding at a hotel for awhile she looked
about and decided on Loraine place. The
houses stood in a row, but they had a pretty
court yard in front, and a real stretch of
ground at the back for grass and flowers and
two fine fruit trees.</p>
<p>Of course old friends sought her out. Perhaps
the fortune helped. The young girls
of her time were matrons with growing children.
How odd it seemed! She thought sometimes
that she felt reprehensibly young, as
if she was having girlhood over again in her
heart, but it was a richer, wiser and more
fervent girlhood, with the added experiences
of the woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>There were many things for her to take
an interest in but they finally settled around
the babies and little children&#8217;s hospital, and
the Settlement House. In a way, she was
fond of the sweet, helpless babies who seemed
so very dependent on human kindness. If
there was one of her own flesh and blood it
would take possession of her very soul, all
her thoughts, all her affection. But it should
have been hers earlier in life. Now she wanted
companionship. She could not wait for it to
develop and then find unpleasant traits that
had come from alien blood. No, she could
not adopt a baby and wait a dozen years
to know whether it would satisfy or not.</p>
<p>She had helped two or three girls to better
things. One through the last two years of
High School and who was now teaching. And
there had been one with a charming voice
and an attractive face who had been injured
in a mill and who would never have perfect
use of her right hand. If she could be trained
for a singer!</p>
<p>She and Doctor Richards came to words
about her. He said plainly she would not
be worth the money spent upon her. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
Miss Armitage insisted on spending it a year
when the girl threw up her friend and joined
a concert troupe, slipping presently into
vaudeville where she <i>was</i> a success.</p>
<p>And out of the dispute came a proffer of
love and marriage. Alvah Richards had
begun life at the opposite pole from Miss
Armitage. There had been a fortune, a love
for the study of medicine, a degree in Vienna
and one at Paris. Then most of the fortune
had been swept away. He returned to America
and some way drifted to Newton. They
were just starting the hospital and he found
plenty to do. He could live frugally. To
help his still poorer fellow creatures in suffering,
to restore them to strength and teach
them to be useful members of society, or to
comfort them and make the path easier over
the river to the other country; this was his
highest aim.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage was almost dumb with surprise.
She raised her hand in entreaty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t! don&#8217;t,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It is quite
impossible; it cannot be. I like you very
much, but I am not in love. And then&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221; with eager eyes and incisive
voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You had a birthday last week. I heard
you telling it. You are thirty-one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8221; There was a proud smile on his
manly face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when my birthday comes, I shall be
thirty-six. When you are sixty, rich in experience,
famous, a real man among men, I
shall be quite an old woman. No, I shouldn&#8217;t
do it for your sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As if a few years made any difference!
Why you could discount seven years at least.
Have you been loved so much that you can
throw away a man&#8217;s honest, honorable, tender
love that will last all his life, that wear it
as you like, in any stress, you can never wear
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You have spoiled a
splendid friendship. I liked you so much, I
have no love to give in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us be friends again. I would
rather have you for a friend than any other
woman for a wife. I simply will not give you
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the pendulum went on swinging evenly
between the two points, when Cinderella entered
both lives.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>And now it was Sunday morning and the
chimes were pealing&mdash;&#8220;Oh, come all ye faithful.&#8221;
Marilla listened with a throb of joy,
though she did not know the words they were
saying in sweetest melody. Miss Armitage
came and stood by the cot with a cordial good
morning.</p>
<p>Marilla stretched out her hand and glanced
up with an entreating sort of smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was I very bad last night?&#8221; she asked in
a wistful tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad? Why&mdash;what was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking it over. Oh, I didn&#8217;t
want to go back to Mrs. Borden. It is so
lovely and quiet and beautiful here. But it
<i>is</i> right. I am her bound-out girl, and I <i>was</i>
glad to go there. You wouldn&#8217;t like me to be
always looking for what was nice and pleasant
and shirking other things, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear.&#8221; She stooped and kissed her. She
had been going over some arguments fitted for
a child&#8217;s understanding, and she was afraid
of a rather painful time. And the worst to her
was the fact that she had come to love the
child and really desired her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The babies, you know, are so fond of me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and they are all very good. So I wouldn&#8217;t have
any reason for not staying with them. And
it will be only five years more, then I shall be
eighteen. And I thought&mdash;&#8221; flushing daintily,
&#8220;that maybe Jane might marry, and you
would want some one in her place and if
it was&mdash;me,&#8221; rather tremulously&mdash;&#8220;I could
come&mdash;I love you so. I&#8217;d be your Cinderella
always. And when I go back it will be like
the King&#8217;s ball&mdash;I shall keep thinking how
lovely it was for you to bring me here instead
of sending me to a hospital, and it will comfort
me just as the music did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage bent over and kissed her
but there were tears in her eyes. She was
touched with the child&#8217;s reasoning that was
so like heroism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We will think of
it that way. And if you should be ill at any
time, I will have you brought here, and you
shall stop when you take the babies out and
let me see them, and rest a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh that will be just lovely. You are so
good,&#8221; and she kissed the white hand lying
on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Then Jane came in and she had her bath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
How delightful it was to be rubbed so carefully,
to have her curly mop brushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to dress myself now. Why I&#8217;m
not sick at all only I get tired easily, but I
am stronger every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The breakfast was so nice. And to be
waited upon! Marilla gave an inward laugh
of delight.</p>
<p>And while Miss Armitage was at church,
Dr. Richards came and bundled her up, carried
her downstairs and deposited her in the
buggy. He was very merry, somehow. He
was going out in the country and, oh, how
beautiful everything was! There had been a
shower in the night and the air was full of
fragrance from the grass, the pines and
cedars, the orchards, wild flowers, and newly
cut hay, that had not all been gathered in.
Children ran about or swung in hammocks.
Hens were fairly shouting with no regard
for Sunday. Birds were caroling all sorts of
joyous tunes and the tree twigs were gaily
dancing. And here and there such beautiful
drifts went over the sky, ships, she called them.
They were going to fairy land&mdash;something
that was not quite heaven, but a lovely place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
for all that. There must be so many lovely
places in this great world! Over the ocean
where Miss Armitage had been, and she recalled
the castles and palaces and beautiful
woods, and peasants dancing on the green
and laughing; that she had seen in the portfolio
of engravings. And the legends she
had listened to! Oh, if she could go to school
and learn ever so many things <i>now</i>, for when
she was eighteen she would be too old, and
a kind of perplexity settled in her smooth
forehead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A DAY TO BE REMEMBERED</h3>
</div>
<p>Dr. Richards had been studying the changes
in the child&#8217;s face. It was like reading a book,
but it had many variations. Her thoughts
must have traveled far and wide. What were
they?</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you very happy?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy?&#8221; she echoed, wonderingly. &#8220;Why
it is a beautiful Sunday. One ought to be
happy&mdash;here with you and watching all these
lovely things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are Sundays happier than any other
days?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8221; slowly. &#8220;They ought to be.
It seems as if it was the day of the Sun, and
that&#8217;s always glad and merry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when it rains or is cloudy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you <i>know</i> it is there, and maybe He
is fighting away the clouds. And He draws
up the water. I read that in a book&mdash;and
when He gets enough He lets it fall down as He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
did last night and that makes the world so fresh
and sweet. And there are fifty-two Sundays
when you ought not&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; watching the shadow in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think you ought not work very
much. I suppose some people have to when
you have meals to get and babies to see to.
I go to Sunday school with Jack and I like
it so much. I&#8217;ve learned ever so many of
the songs. But the lessons puzzle me. They
are about God&mdash;we had them in the Home, you
know, and God seems so big and strange. Do
you know all about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, child, and no one, not even ministers
can know all, so you need not worry about
that. God has the whole world in His
keeping. Don&#8217;t you like the week days?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they don&#8217;t seem to have the same
joy in them, only at Miss Armitage&#8217;s every
day seems like Sunday. But I keep counting
them. You see, I&#8217;ll be thirteen in September.
Then when we&#8217;ve had fifty-two Sundays I&#8217;ll
be fourteen and so on, until I am eighteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; in a sweet kind of tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why I won&#8217;t be bound-out any more. It&#8217;s
right for me to stay, <i>she</i> said so, but it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
seem such a long while if I was just counting
the years. And Sunday comes so quick,
most times, and then you can be glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a touch of philosophy for a child!</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;they are good to you at Bordens?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I <i>love</i> Bridget, though I was
afraid of her at first. But the grown people
have each other and since I don&#8217;t really
belong to them&mdash;oh, I can&#8217;t explain it,&#8221;
and the knot came back to her brow.
&#8220;You see when you&#8217;re bound-out and going
away for a while they can&#8217;t feel the same
to you. They&#8217;re never real cross and they
don&#8217;t whip you as they did at the Home, and
you have nicer things to eat. Sometimes
when you were awful hungry you didn&#8217;t
seem to get enough. You wanted one more
piece of bread, but you couldn&#8217;t have it.
Oh, I like it so much better at Mrs. Borden&#8217;s
Only Jack&mdash;Are boys always bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they are for the most part,&#8221;
laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he will go to school again. And his
father says he will outgrow it. His father
truly does want him to be good, and he said
I must tell when he pinched me or kicked me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
and he would punish him. But I don&#8217;t like
to, always, for he denies it, and his mother
isn&#8217;t pleased when I do. You can feel when
people do not like you to tell things. At
the Home when you told tales they whipped
the child that was bad, and then they whipped
you for telling tales. It didn&#8217;t seem as if
that was quite fair, so I tried never to tell
on anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, it is a bad habit,&#8221;
he commented, gravely.</p>
<p>Then they had reached their destination.
A poor old paralyzed man sat in a wheeling
chair on the porch. Medical skill could not
do much for him, but friendship and interest
made pleasant times to remember when the
hours were long and weary. Dr. Richards
had brought some illustrated magazines, and
they talked over the happenings of the week.</p>
<p>A sweet-faced, rather elderly lady brought
Marilla a rocking chair, and asked her if she
was the doctor&#8217;s patient. Then she offered
her a piece of cake and a lovely pear, and afterward
took her down to see the flower garden
that was fairly rioting in beauty, and a flock
of snowy white chickens, as well as some fine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
pigeons that circled around like swallows.
She was the wife, and there was a daughter
who had gone to church. She talked of Dr.
Richards, how good and comforting he was
to &#8220;father.&#8221; Marilla thought he must be
good to everybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a lovely time with you,&#8221; the child
said. Then she shook hands with &#8220;father,&#8221;
who said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;re the doctor&#8217;s little girl?&#8221;
His mind was not always clear on some points.
&#8220;Come again, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled and nodded. &#8220;The doctor&#8217;s
little girl,&#8221; how sweet it sounded! But of
course that could not be.</p>
<p>They had a delightful ride home though it
was growing warmer. How beautiful her
eyes were today&mdash;a sort of gray-violet, and
the bronze lashes almost curled. And as he
listened to her soft, flowing voice, he kept
thinking&mdash;if he was to marry some one and
have a little girl full of quaint ideas as this
one was! But it would take a long, long
while, and he sighed.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage was sitting by the parlor
window when they returned, and she came to
the door to meet them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I ran away with your little invalid,&#8221;
the doctor exclaimed. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I brought her
back improved?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her cheeks were positively rosy and were
rounded out by the exquisite shading. She
clasped her small arms around Miss Armitage.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve had the most splendid time! A
real Sunday. We&#8217;ve been out in the beautiful
country where birds were singing hymns and
I&#8217;m just full of happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had kept their pact, these two people;
they could not have worked together otherwise,
and each one was following the same
path, for the good of the poor of this world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are not going to scold me?&#8221; with
a questioning smile. &#8220;I promised her a
drive you know, and today was rather a
holiday to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, she doesn&#8217;t scold,&#8221; cried Marilla
in a sort of joyful contradiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in and have some dinner
with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pete would grumble if he stood here an
hour. Now, if you would change it to supper&mdash;and
a cup of tea&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let be a cup of tea, then. I want to talk
over some plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Expect me on the mark. Six,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m just delighted,&#8221; and Marilla
squeezed his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you had a lovely time. Where did
you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;through the park and then out on
such a beautiful road. Things seem nicer
on Sunday, because there isn&#8217;t so much noise.
And there was an old man who has to get
about in a chair with little wheels, and can&#8217;t
walk any more. And the lady gave me some
cake and such a luscious pear, and asked me to
come again. I just wished that there was
some little girl from the Home living there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla had her face and hands washed,
and a fresh white frock put on. She was so
bright and chatty and really charming. But
after dinner she lay in the Morris chair and
Miss Armitage read her to sleep. It seemed
as if she had improved so much in the
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>They had such a genial and charming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
supper, and Miss Armitage played on the
organ afterward and then talked about the
girls who were going to the Rest House next
week. Five of them were very much worn
out. They would need to stay a full fortnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think one of them needs some medical
attention. Come to the Settlement and
see her before she starts. And you know
I am booked for that Canadian journey with
the Winslows. I am almost sorry I promised.
Do you think it would be safe to let the
child go to the Bordens on Saturday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t let her go back! She is
worth something better than baby tending.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have cured her up so soon!
I don&#8217;t exactly see my way clear or I should
keep her for good and all. I like her very
much. You may laugh at me about my
swans being ordinary geese&mdash;but we must
admit the Bordens have the right to her at
present. And I do not want to make bad
friends with them, seeing that in law he may
exact the pound of flesh. They may tire of
her or she may not be able to stand the babies
and Jack. I could leave her here with Jane
or send her to the Home. But she is very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
much resigned to the return. She has a
curious bit of conscience about it. So it is
best to let her try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear the thought of it.&#8221; He
uttered it with vehemence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it much myself. But it
seems the only way at present. Bridget will
look out for her. We can&#8217;t accuse them of
any cruelty or neglect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she fairly worships you&mdash;fairy godmother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I were. I should change the lot of
more than one Cinderella. Well&mdash;we will
wait and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla came in with a bunch of flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane said I might pick them for the
doctor, and the ride was so nice. I shall
put it in among the splendid things of my
life&mdash;like the dream, and coming here&mdash;and
when I get settled in bed and all is dark I
can make a real fairy land out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her flowers and kissed her, and
said &#8220;Good-night&#8221; to them in a low tone.
But he went home racking his brains to see
if something could not be done toward keeping
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>Bridget came around one afternoon and
was enthusiastic over her improvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re doing pretty well and I believe
the twins are not to get any more teeth in a
year or two. And the boss says they&#8217;ve
thinned out astonishing, and they can talk
a good bit. And that girl&#8217;s going to the other
place and they say you just must come down.
But not a foot should you stir if you wasn&#8217;t
real well. An&#8217; its glad enough I am to have
himself at breakfast at the morn and dinner
at night. It&#8217;s like living again, but I don&#8217;t
want to see any more twins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla laughed. &#8220;Yes, I feel all well only
sometimes I have a little catch in my breath;
and I&#8217;ll be ready to go on Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ll just be praying to the saints to
send you back safe and sound. I don&#8217;t see
why people should be kitin&#8217; off to strange
places, when they&#8217;ve a good, comfortable
house to stay in. But the saints be praised
for the rest with that imp of a Jack being
away! They do be grown up after awhile
an&#8217; I s&#8217;pose you couldn&#8217;t have men if there
were no boy babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Borden called late one afternoon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
and brought a note from his wife. Ellen had
to leave on Saturday or lose the nice place,
and the babies were well now, walking all
round and beginning to say cunning words.
Pansy called &#8220;Illa, Illa,&#8221; and then looked
around for Marilla to come, and said&mdash;&#8220;Papa
bing Illa.&#8221; They wanted her so much. All
their meals were taken over in the next cottage,
and the laundress came twice a week for
the washings. The children were out of
doors most of the time, and they were on the
ground floor, so there was no going up and
down stairs. Marilla would have it very
easy and they would take the best of care of
her.</p>
<p>Mr. Borden was both kind and gentlemanly.
He hoped there would be some way in which
they could repay Miss Armitage for all
her care. Would she accept a contribution for
the Babies&#8217; Hospital, he had heard she was
interested in, or any other charity?</p>
<p>It was very nice of him, Miss Armitage
thought, and she chose the hospital. Marilla
had been out walking with Jane and when she
came in Mr. Borden was so cordial that it
won the child&#8217;s heart, and she was the more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
willing to go because she should lose her dear
Miss Armitage for a month.</p>
<p>&#8220;And afterward, you must come and see
me and we will have nice times together, and
I may teach you a little music&mdash;you learn so
easily. Oh, I count on seeing a good deal of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parting was not as bitter as Miss
Armitage had feared, partly because Mr. Borden
was there and in such good spirits, and
Marilla was thinking that the month would
soon pass and that in any event she could
not see her dear fairy godmother in that
time.</p>
<p>The journey interested her very much.
She had never taken so long a ride in the cars.
Mr. Borden bought her a box of marshmallows
and he had some illustrated papers. And
there at the station was Miss Florence who
gave her a cordial welcome, and the big
surrey drove them and three other passengers
to their destination. Mrs. Borden ran down
the path to meet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on pins and needles lest something
should happen,&#8221; she began. &#8220;Why, Marilla,
you don&#8217;t look as if you had ever been ill!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
And we&#8217;re so glad to get you back. Oh, you
don&#8217;t know what an awful time I had, and
at first the babies wouldn&#8217;t let Ellen touch
them. Flo or I had to feed them. I&#8217;m clear
worn out now, but I do hope the babies
haven&#8217;t forgotten you, for I want a little
rest. It seemed too bad that you should have
given out just then. And I do believe you&#8217;ve
grown taller. Why, you are quite a big girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins sat on a blanket on the grassy
space at the side of the house. Mrs. Borden
led the girl out to them with a glad sound
in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your dear Illa come,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Dear Illa that you&#8217;ve wanted so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pansy looked up. Marilla gave one spring
and knelt down beside them. It was nice to
be longed for, to be remembered. She had
really loved them. Her heart was always
reaching out for something to love.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illa, Illa,&#8221; almost shouted Pansy and went
down head first in Marilla&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you darling!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t get weaned away,
Marilla. I was afraid you would, having
such a fuss made over you. Mr. Borden said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
the house was fine. That Miss Armitage must
be rich. Well&mdash;she was very good to you
and did the best she could for us. But that
Ellen didn&#8217;t like children, that was the long
and the short of it, and she has just the place
for her, and eighteen dollars a month. Yes,
Violet, this is our own Marilla come back to
us, and we shall never let her go away again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet had looked rather wary and been
chewing on the end of her thumb, but now
she nodded and began to hitch toward Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re going over to the cottage to
dinner. It&#8217;s such a pleasure to go together.
I always take Jack. He has nice table manners
if he isn&#8217;t an angel otherwise. Oh, there
he is! Jack, here&#8217;s Marilla!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack gave a sort of wild howl of delight and
started on a run with outstretched arms.
Over went Marilla and Pansy and Jack on
the top of the heap. Pansy gave a smothered
scream.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden caught Jack by the shoulder
and dragged him up. &#8220;You bad, bad boy!&#8221;
she exclaimed, angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! what&#8217;s the row?&#8221; asked Mr. Borden,
advancing to the fray.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>Jack rubbed his eyes to make some tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you said you was glad to see her an&#8217; so
was I. An&#8217; I was jest gone&#8217; to hug her an&#8217;
the bug fell over, an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Borden laughed. Mrs. Borden picked
up Pansy and comforted her. But she did
howl as if she had been half killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, go to Aunt Florence and be made
ready for dinner,&#8221; in a commanding tone.
&#8220;Oh dear, it does seem&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well things will go better now,&#8221; said
Mr. Borden soothingly. &#8220;Marilla, you are
going to be the salvation of the household.
Did the twins really know her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pansy did, I think Pansy&#8217;s really smarter
that Violet, I do hope we&#8217;ll have a little comfort
now. There Pansy, dear, go to your
sweet Marilla,&#8221; and she stood the child
down. &#8220;We must hurry or we will be late
for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla saw the four go over to the cottage,
as it was called. She had been tired out
with the railroad journey, entertaining as
it was, then the excitement of meeting them
all again, the bump on her forehead when
she had come down so hard on Pansy&#8217;s head,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
and the screams that seemed like a stab going
from temple to temple tired her inexpressibly.
Then, too, she was hungry. Oh, if she could
have a glass of hot milk such as Jane used to
bring her! She really could not help crying a
little. Both babies stood up by her. Violet
pounding on one shoulder, Pansy making a
grab at her hair that seemed to pull it out by
the roots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pitty, pitty!&#8221; she said gleefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Pansy dear, you hurt.&#8221; She disentangled
the one hand, but the other made
the same clutch and was more difficult to
manage. Then she rose to her knees that her
head might be out of reach. Violet came down
heavily and began to cry. Poor Marilla
hardly knew what to do.</p>
<p>The babies were much thinner and their
faces not so pudgy, but Marilla thought they
still resembled the Campbell soup little girl
and laughed in spite of her own hurts. Then
Violet spied a green apple and made a bee
line for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t bite it,&#8221; thought Marilla, and
as it kept rolling it amused the baby. Then
Pansy crept toward it and there was a rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
funny time. Violet slapped her twin in the
face and there was another howl and Marilla
went to the rescue. Oh, what should she
do? Everything was so strange!</p>
<p>&#8220;Bed&#8217;y mik, bed&#8217;y mik,&#8221; demanded Pansy,
&#8220;Bed&#8217;y milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go and find some,&#8221; and she raised
the baby to her feet, taking her by the hand.
They walked up on the porch, and she placed
her in the carriage while she glanced at Violet.
Not a moment too soon&mdash;the little sharp
teeth were making inroads on the apple. She
ran and snatched it, throwing it out of sight.
There was another howl. Mrs. Borden came
hurrying down.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; rather crossly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violet found an apple and bit in it; I threw
it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was right Marilla,&#8221; in a mollified
tone. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Pansy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the porch, in the carriage. I think
she&#8217;s hungry. It sounded as if she meant
bread and milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. They have that for their supper.
I guess I can start it. I used to feed them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
first. Let me see. I guess I can show you&mdash;you&#8217;re
so handy unless they&#8217;ve spoiled you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had Violet in her arms and said&mdash;&#8220;Bring
in Pansy,&#8221; leading the way to a room
that seemed a general storage place. She
lighted the little pyro stove, opened a closet
and took out a saucepan, a bottle of milk, a
sugar dish and some spoons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now as soon as it gets warm, you fix it&mdash;you
cannot have forgotten how, and then turn
this screw and put the light out. For
heaven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t set anything afire! Oh,
there&#8217;s no place like your own home. I
haven&#8217;t had an hour&#8217;s comfort since I came
down here. And my dinner&#8217;s getting cold.
Nice baked veal it was, with dressing. There
babies, Marilla will give you some nice bread
and milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ran off. The babies whined a little and
then watched the proceedings. The stove
stood up on a table and she poured out part
of the milk. Then she gave the babies a
crust of bread to stop their clamoring while
she crumbed up some in the saucepan and
kept stirring it so that it shouldn&#8217;t scorch,
taking out part, presently. Pansy climbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
up by a chair and began to call &#8220;Bed&#8217;y mik,
bed&#8217;y mik.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla put on her bib and began to feed
her. Then Violet joined with her starvation
cry. First it was one open pink mouth then
the other. The viands disappeared as if by
magic. She meant to have a little for herself&mdash;she
was so weak and gone in the stomach,
but she found she must make some more, even,
for the babies. So she crumbed up the remainder
of the loaf. How they <i>did</i> eat!
She was very tired of ladling it in each little
mouth.</p>
<p>She had a very little left for herself, but
it seemed to help the desperately tired feeling.
She had put the stove out without any mishap.
Pansy began to cry&mdash;&#8220;Wock, wock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it dear? Was it anything more
to eat?&#8221; She glanced through the closet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wock, wock,&#8221; hanging to her skirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me wock,&#8221; joined in the chorus that might
be Chinese.</p>
<p>Oh, would they never come! She took the
babies out on the porch. There was a big
rocker. Pansy ran to it and patted it,
rolling up her eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Rock. I might have guessed, but
my head feels so tired and queer.&#8221; Then she
took the cushions and blankets out of the
carriage and lifted up Violet, settling her in
one side. But Pansy would have none of it.
She squirmed down on the floor and began
to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know what you want!&#8221;
Marilla almost fell into the chair and jogged
it gently. Violet was going to sleep. Poor
Cinderella wiped the tears that would have
run down her cheeks. She was so tired.
Even the babies crying did not move her.
But when she heard the voices she sprang up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what is the matter?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Borden.</p>
<p>&#8220;They wanted to be rocked,&#8221; explained
Marilla, &#8220;and I put them both in the chair,
but Pansy wouldn&#8217;t stay&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have spoiled them. Ellen used to sit
in the chair and hold them both. That
seemed about the only thing she could do that
would please them. And I&#8217;ve held one in the
right and Aunt Florence the other until my
back ached and I was fit to fall to pieces. We&#8217;ve
had the most awful time, Flo and I. But I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
remember I had a dreadful time cutting
my wisdom teeth, and I was grown. I used
to walk the floor at night, they would swell
up so. We can&#8217;t blame the poor babies.
And they missed you so. They used to be so
good, wasn&#8217;t they M&#8217;rilla; and I suppose
they&#8217;ll be good again. They must be undressed
and put to bed. Flo, you look after
Violet, and M&#8217;rilla you run over and get
some dinner. You must be most starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden had picked up Pansy who had
now turned to her comforting thumb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, run over. You needn&#8217;t be afraid.
Ellen liked the girls first rate. Here, Mr.
Borden will escort you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you&#8217;re tired out and homesick,&#8221;
he said sympathetically. &#8220;But we will have
things better tomorrow. And we are all
so glad to have you&mdash;this way. Here, Katie,
give this little girl a good dinner. She deserves
the best you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were clearing the dining room. One
long table was piled up with the used dishes.
At the other, covered with rather worn enameled
cloth, sat two women and one young
man. Kate made a place for the child and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
brought her a plate with most everything
piled on it. Bridget, at home, was so much
neater, but then she didn&#8217;t have so many
hungry people to feed. And Jane with her
dainty ways!</p>
<p>Oh, she was just a little bound-out nurse
girl. She had danced and feasted with the
prince; she had been in the palace with the
fairy godmother where she was waited on
as if she were a little lady. And there had been
the Sunday ride with Dr. Richards. Was it
<i>all</i> dreams?</p>
<p>She could not eat. The food was mostly
cold. There was a big lump in her throat and
a heaviness in her heart. How long and
dreary the five years looked!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hungry,&#8221; and she pushed the
plate away.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll have some pudding and some
cream. I told you, Maggie, they&#8217;d stuff theirselves
on that there puddin&#8217;! You can beat
the band on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just have the cream,&#8221; the little girl
said, timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well you won&#8217;t last long to take care of
them there babies if you can&#8217;t eat better&#8217;n
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
that!&#8221; said Katie. &#8220;I never see such squabs
in my life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Katie, that won&#8217;t do. They&#8217;re
&#8216;Kate Greenaway&#8217; children. Was she some
one who fatted up young ones? Well, she&#8217;d
better let &#8217;em alone to my thinkin&#8217;. And their
great round eyes! And the crossest things I
ever did see! Mrs. Munson thought she&#8217;d
have to give up t&#8217; other side of the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; cautioned Maggie, with a
slight turn of the head.</p>
<p>Marilla ate her cream, and it really tasted
good. Then she rose and said good-night in a
quiet fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katie, you must remember about little
pitchers,&#8221; cautioned some one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;that&#8217;s a nice little girl and I don&#8217;t
believe she&#8217;d carry tales. Ellen said she
wouldn&#8217;t take care of those babies for ten
dollars a week. And what&#8217;s this child ever
going to do&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Borden is a nice kind of a man and
when he&#8217;s around that Jack behaves like a
little gentleman, and the ladies do very well;
they&#8217;re pleasant and don&#8217;t put on airs. But
what they&#8217;ll do with those twins&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they won&#8217;t always be getting teeth.
It&#8217;s a hard time with babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so they gossiped while they washed
dishes and set the kitchen in order for morning.
If they had ever been Cinderella they had forgotten
about it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A NEW GLIMPSE OF SERVITUDE</h3>
</div>
<p>Marilla wandered about a little. The stars
were coming out and afar off the wood robin
was singing his low sweet song. The dew was
scattering the fragrance of flower and shrub
and she drew in long breaths of it that seemed
to revive her. Was Miss Armitage sitting at the
organ and evoking the music that stirred one&#8217;s
very being and made you wish unutterable
things? And would Dr. Richards go to comfort
some poor patient tomorrow?</p>
<p>Then she went to her new home. Miss
Florence sat alone on the porch. The babies
were soundly asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have a nice dinner?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;And I suppose you are very tired. Will you
sit here awhile or would you rather go to bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I would like to go to bed,&#8221; she answered,
wearily.</p>
<p>They went through the place they were
using for a sort of kitchen and up a narrow
stairway. Only part of the room had a fair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
ceiling, the rest slanted down to some narrow
windows. There was a cot, an old fashioned
wash stand and a sort of closet. Their packing
trunks were up here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Borden had taken the other part the
house first. There is more room and it is
rather nicer. But the woman who had taken
this wanted so to exchange and made an offer
in the rent and they do charge scandalously
for these summer places. And when you&#8217;re
not keeping house it doesn&#8217;t matter so much.
It saves lots of trouble. They just give meals
over there and they are first rate. I put your
clothes that we brought in that closet. It
was very nice in Miss Armitage to get you
some others and she wouldn&#8217;t let Mr. Borden
pay for them. I want to hear all about her
tomorrow. You won&#8217;t feel afraid, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; was the reply. It didn&#8217;t seem to
matter much what happened to her now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, then, I hope you will sleep
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; steadying her tone.</p>
<p>She thought she wouldn&#8217;t sleep at all, but
her poor little body was so tired out that exhausted
nature demanded rest. And she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
awakened in the morning with the singing of
some birds, and a beautiful poem floated
through her mind. She would not count any
Sundays until September came in.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden called her and she replied, dressing
quickly and going down stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you look quite rested,&#8221; said the lady.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give the babies their bath and dress them
and then you will give them their breakfast
and keep them out on the porch while we go
for ours. They take only one nap now, sleeping
from eleven until about two. They just
have bread and milk. There&#8217;s a woman here
who says I am ruining their health with that,
because it makes them fat, but they were
fed when they had only milk. Then they
have some oatmeal, jelly and a soft boiled
egg when they wake up. There&#8217;s nothing
like system; you know just what to do. Now
you go over to the kitchen and get a bottle
of milk. The babies drink that, too. Then
I&#8217;ll show you how to light up the stove. It&#8217;s
the handiest little thing. I couldn&#8217;t manage
without it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla had a pleasant greeting from Katie
who declared, &#8220;she looked ten per cent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
better and hoped she would have a good
appetite for her breakfast as she didn&#8217;t eat
enough to keep a bird alive last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The babies were pretty good natured, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know they always were real sweet,&#8221;
said their mother, &#8220;and so easily amused. I
hope you haven&#8217;t forgotten your knack of
story telling; and how they used to laugh!
That Ellen was the stupidest thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>While she was feeding the babies, the grown
folks went over to their breakfast. The kitchen
and the servants&#8217; table was in much better
order, and there were some delightful muffins
and fresh fish and muskmelons. The babies
played about; Jack&#8217;s father took him out for
a walk, then there was a long quiet time at the
luncheon hour, and the babies were fed
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I succeeded in getting a two-seat carriage,
so we will all go out this afternoon,&#8221; said
Mr. Borden. &#8220;They say Braun is a queer
Hungarian settlement and on Sunday the
people are all out in their best. We&#8217;ll take a
look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Can</i> we all go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Florence said she wouldn&#8217;t mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
caring for one baby, and Marilla can take the
other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two nurses had the back seat, Florence
made Marilla put her baby between them on
the seat. &#8220;We&#8217;ll change off when I get tired
of holding mine,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>They went straight over to the Sound&mdash;the
upper end of the great South Bay. Oh how
splendid it was! Marilla almost held her
breath with surprise, then they drove up the
road a short distance, but she hated to leave
the glorious views. Pansy dropped in her
lap and went to sleep. As they turned they
passed through one of the magnificent residential
settlements, then to the odd Hungarian
town where a foreign Sunday was in full life
and vivacity.</p>
<p>Little tables were standing around, some
filled with families, some having a couple of
lovers; other parties were walking up and down;
all in picturesque holiday attire. The tables
were set out with small, hard brown cakes, slices
of bread that each had brought to the feast.
There was beer of course, merrymaking and
jollity&mdash;but no one seemed to overstep the
bounds. Children ran around, grotesque
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
copies of their elders. Rows of cottages and
gardens, great corn and hayfields, stubble
where cattle were browsing, enclosures of
fattening pigs whose squealing had a mirthful
sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well worth looking at,&#8221; said Mr. Borden.
&#8220;A bit of Europe on one of our islands
and really a lesson to our own thriftless poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet chattered in a funny fashion, but
Pansy slept through it all. Marilla tried
several times to shift her position, but the
little form was too heavy to stir. Yet it was
delightful, though she kept thinking of last
Sunday and Dr. Richards.</p>
<p>Mr. Borden stopped at the gate and helped
them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lift Pansy, she&#8217;s asleep,&#8221; said Aunt
Florence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marilla, why didn&#8217;t you keep her
awake! I&#8217;ve been trying not to let them
sleep in the afternoon so they would go to
bed the earlier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you get a baby in good habits,
someone comes along and spoils it all,&#8221;
exclaimed Mrs. Borden in a vexed tone. She
was a little tired, having answered at least
fifty questions for Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>But Pansy woke when her father stood
her down, and said, rather drowsily&mdash;&#8220;Nice
horsey;&#8221; and sat squarely down in the path.
Aunt Florence picked her up and led her to
the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Marilla, get their suppers ready
and feed them. And put away their things.
I can&#8217;t bear to see them lying round on chairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Borden drove off, taking Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ont bedy-milk,&#8221; announced Violet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; go to Marilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child had laid the caps in the drawer
and hung up the coats. Both children came
out and clamored for supper and pulled on her
skirt until they almost tipped her over.</p>
<p>Then the great bell clanged for the boarders&#8217;
supper. They had dinner at noon on Sundays.
Mr. Borden returned and escorted
the ladies over. This was always a rather
chatty, long-drawn-out meal.</p>
<p>Marilla fed the babies, washed and put
away her few dishes, then took the children
out on the porch. Violet wanted to be
&#8220;wocked,&#8221; so she sat beside her in the big
porch chair. Pansy ran up and down uttering
queer unmusical noises. The piano in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
other part of the house was accompanying
a singer.</p>
<p>The mistress of that part leaned out of the
window and said in a sharp tone&mdash;&#8220;Can&#8217;t
you keep that child still? She&#8217;s an awful
nuisance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go indoors,&#8221; said Marilla. &#8220;Come,
and I&#8217;ll tell you a story about a bunny that
got lost away from all his folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Pansy had no mind to come. She
screamed when Marilla took hold of her arm
and then kicked, jerking away, she rolled down
the three steps, landing on the grass. Marilla,
frightened, picked her up in her arms and ran
through the hall with her. The suddenness
had really taken the breath out of the little
body for a moment, then she looked rather
wildly at her rescuer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t hurt you much and you were a
naughty baby to run away! Don&#8217;t cry any
more and you shall have&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; she cast
about to see what solace there was&mdash;&#8220;oh,
you shall have some sugar&mdash;see&mdash;&#8221; and
she offered her some in a spoon.</p>
<p>Pansy laughed and reached out for the
sugar, quite restored to good humor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll go out and get sister and you
shall have some more sugar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet came in quite willingly. She sat on
the floor with them and thought of the stories
she used to tell. This one was about a runaway
squirrel. It grew dark and he was afraid,
for he heard a queer noise that kept saying,
&#8220;Who&mdash;who,&#8221; so he ran another way. Then
a dog barked, and Marilla made the sound
of a dog and both babies laughed delightedly.
&#8220;So he ran as fast as he could but the dog
ran, too, and the squirrel climbed up in a
tree,&#8221; and Marilla climbed with her hands
on the back of the chair in a funny fashion.
&#8220;&#8216;Come down,&#8217; said the dog. &#8216;I won&#8217;t,&#8217; said
the squirrel. &#8216;Then I&#8217;ll climb up and eat you.&#8217;
But the squirrel laughed and said: &#8216;You can&#8217;t
climb a tree.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The babies laughed, too, but Violet wanted to
be &#8220;wocked&#8221; again. She really was sleepy.
So Marilla put them both in the rocking chair
and began another story about a bird who had
three little babies in a nest and had to go
out and get them something to eat. The
ladies came back and Violet began to nod
and let her eyes droop.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They must go to bed,&#8221; said their mother.</p>
<p>It was supposed that Pansy would make
a protest. She slipped down out of the chair
and held out her fat little hand, murmuring&mdash;&#8220;Illa,
Illa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Illa shall put you to bed, come
Violet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs Borden found their nighties. &#8220;Me
too,&#8221; and Violet took hers over to Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, isn&#8217;t that cunning? Marilla they
are getting back all their old love for you!
But it is time I had a little rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The babies were safely deposited in their
crib, each with a thumb in her mouth, a rather
recent habit. Then they went out on the porch
again. Jack was there with his chum, Stevie.
The ladies joined the procession up and down
the board walk. Stevie was recounting some
wonderful experience, so Marilla dropped into
a chair and her mind went back to last Sunday
night. How long ago it seemed!</p>
<p>Stevie was summoned home by his nurse.
Quite a party went to the kind of sacred
concert. Jack crawled up beside Marilla, for
he was getting sleepy. When she proposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
he should go to bed he turned obstinate and
held on tight to the arm of the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go to bed. I&#8217;m going to stay here
until mama comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you must. The clocks have struck
eight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to.&#8221; He caught the
arm of the chair. &#8220;You try now and I&#8217;ll kick
you with my hind leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>She knew well enough that he would kick.
Somehow she did not feel equal to the struggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me a story,&#8221; was his next demand.
&#8220;About somebody being put in the pit. Sunday
school teacher told it. Why, I&#8217;d climb
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she told him the story and then another,
rocking slowly, and as the demand ceased she
knew he was asleep. But she did not dare try
to get him to bed. So she went to her own
thoughts, the last week passed with the fairy
godmother and Dr. Richards.</p>
<p>It was ten when the family returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marilla, how <i>could</i> you let him go to
sleep! He&#8217;s so cross when you wake him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get him to go&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jack!&#8221; His father picked him up and
carried him to the sleeping room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you run to bed,&#8221; said the mistress,
still sharply.</p>
<p>It was very well, Marilla thought, that Jack
had a companion who was not fond of &#8220;kids.&#8221;
Stevie lived quite a distance below and had
brought no end of playthings, had an auto
wagon that two could sit in, though only
one could be chauffeur. So Marilla had the
babies out on the side lawn all the morning
in the shade, and after their nap took them
out in the carriage. They were quite fond
of walking, too. They really were rather
amiable again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Florence, could I have some paper
and a pencil?&#8221; she asked during their noontide
nap. &#8220;I promised to write to Dr. Richards
and tell him if I kept well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not to Miss Armitage?&#8221; was the
inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was going to Canada, and&mdash;I&#8217;m quite
well again, and the babies are so much better.
He will be glad to hear, for he felt very sorry
about them, and he said I must write.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Miss Armitage&#8217;s house is very
grand, much finer than ours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful and she has such a lovely
organ. Well, it&#8217;s different and there are two
big parlors and some curious things that I
never saw before and chairs in beautiful
light blue, all flowered, and some tall vases
and marble statues. And there&#8217;s Jane and
Norah&mdash;and the wash goes out. Yes, I suppose
she&#8217;s rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;d like to live there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she wouldn&#8217;t want me,&#8221; the child
said simply.</p>
<p>Evidently there had been no talk about it.</p>
<p>Miss Borden gave her pencil and paper.</p>
<p>Marilla went to the kitchen nursery, sat
down on a stool and put her paper on the
bottom of the wooden chair. She began&mdash;&#8220;Dear
Dr. Richards.&#8221; Oh, there was so much
to say! She was well and the babies were
improved and could talk a good deal and looked
better for not being so fat. She really liked
home better and Bridget&#8217;s kitchen was so
clean, and there was always a nice white
cloth on the table. It seemed a funny way
to live but many of the people did not have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
meals in their own houses, but went over to
the eating place. &#8220;I can&#8217;t spell the other
word,&#8221; she admitted naively. There were so
many pretty girls in lovely frocks who walked
up and down and didn&#8217;t have to take care
of babies. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I am as fond of
babies as I used to be. I get tired of having
them every day,&#8221; she explained frankly. &#8220;And
soon I shall begin to count on the five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>She filled up the whole sheet, folded,
slipped it in the envelope and fastened it.
Oh, she must ask for a stamp. She could run
down to the postoffice.</p>
<p>Miss Borden was curious to know what
was in the letter, whether Marilla had found
any fault with her surroundings, but the eager,
honest face disarmed curiosity that could
not be easily gratified. So the letter went its
way.</p>
<p>There were many things to entertain a
child whose former life had been narrow. Some
of the girls spoke to her. &#8220;Were the babies
her sisters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. She was&mdash;well their nurse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How odd they looked! Is that little Jack
their brother?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Oh how ardently she wished they
were pretty.</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks more like you than like them.
You&#8217;ve both got such pretty curly hair,
though his is darker. I think curly hair&#8217;s
just lovely. I wish mine curled, and you&#8217;ve
such a pretty dimple in your chin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla blushed at the praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are the babies called?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla repeated their names.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny&mdash;they&#8217;re so much alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;they&#8217;re twins,&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>Then the babies thought it was time they
joined in the conversation, and a funny mess
they made of it. Pansy said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ont to dit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t,&#8221; answered Marilla. &#8220;Their
mother said I must never take them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>They happened to be strapped in very
securely. But Pansy made a great fuss and
gesticulated furiously with her little fists.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had better go on,&#8221; said Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully funny. Does she often get
in such a tantrum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very often,&#8221; returned Marilla half
ashamed and almost afraid the baby would
break the strap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>After a few days she began to get quite acquainted
with some of the girls. They came
from various places and were quite ready to
talk about themselves. There was to be a
lawn party next week at the Sheldon&#8217;s, just
for the girls, and they were going to dance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did you ever go to a ball?&#8221; asked
Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, girls don&#8217;t go to balls! They are
for the big folks. My grown up sister does
and they&#8217;re just splendid.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had half a mind to tell them about
the beautiful dream and how she had danced
with the Prince. But Pansy was going on at
such a rate that she pushed the carriage along
and by the time they reached home she had
forgotten her trouble.</p>
<p>And there was a letter from Dr. Richards.</p>
<p>She wanted to kiss it, she was so glad, but
Mrs. Borden stood there, so she simply said&mdash;&#8220;Thank
you,&#8221; and opened it.</p>
<p>It was quite to a child&#8217;s capacity. Marilla
smiled in some places, looked sad in others.
The little boy who had been so dreadfully
injured by an automobile had died, but he
would have been a terrible cripple if he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
lived. There had been two very hot weeks
and the poor babies had suffered. He was
very glad to hear that the twins were doing
so nicely, and had all their teeth safe and
sound. And was she growing stronger, and
did she have a chance to take the baths
he advised? Miss Armitage was having a
fine time. And a friend was to take them in
his yacht around the islands in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence and come down to Nova Scotia,
so she wouldn&#8217;t be home as soon as they expected.
And he was so busy he couldn&#8217;t have
any vacation at all; but then he had taken
years before and must be satisfied.</p>
<p>There were bits of fun and queer sayings
interspersed that made a sort of jolliness in
her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to read it?&#8221; she asked,
rather timidly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden just did. She and Florence
had wondered whether Marilla had made any
invidious comparisons about the change to
actual service instead of being treated as a
guest in a fine house.</p>
<p>&#8220;If&mdash;you&#8217;d like me to,&#8221; with the proper
hesitation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. And I used to tell him about the
babies, that they were so good and hardly
ever cried, and how I told them stories and
they laughed just as if they understood&mdash;didn&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>made</i> them understand. You&#8217;re an
odd little girl, Marilla, and I don&#8217;t know
what we would do without you, but then you
do really belong to us. I do suppose the
baths would be a good thing if you were not
afraid. Now, we can&#8217;t coax Jack to go in the
water, though he delights to run along the
edge barefooted. That&#8217;s fun for the children.
But you see if we all went some one must
look after the children. Then there&#8217;s the time
for their nap and there&#8217;d be no one to go with
you. There seems so many things to do in the
afternoon now that we have joined the
Clubs. And there&#8217;s teas and things&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Marilla returned, meekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t you go in the water?&#8221; she
asked Jack a few days afterward.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause there&#8217;s sharks. Stevie said so. An&#8217;
they eat up people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they eat up&mdash;well, they haven&#8217;t
eaten up any one yet. We should have heard
of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They only eat up children. The big folks
kick &#8217;em out of the way. But you&#8217;ve got to
be real strong an&#8217; have a big foot. You just
give it to &#8217;em by the side of the jaw and they
flop down in the water. That big Jimmy Lane
has seen them lots of times.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a great sand heap where the
smaller children went to play and tumble
about and build forts and ovens and sometimes
sand each other. Marilla took the babies
out in the carriage after they had their dinner
and were dressed afresh. Sometimes she met
the girls sauntering about, sometimes with the
nurse maids. The two ladies went to a
Whist Club, and one afternoon played Bridge,
and between times they met on each others&#8217;
porches.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the children&#8217;s lawn party
the street was fairly thronged. There were
grown people within the enclosure by special
invitation. And how pretty the young people
were in their beautiful summer attire with
laces and ribbons and bead chains and white
ties with a great bow almost as big as the foot.</p>
<p>There were four pieces of music. Oh, the
dancing was just bewitching? Marilla drew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
long breaths and wished she was among them;
every pulse in her body kept time. The trees
waved and nodded, some birds sang and there
were sounds of happy laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away from here with this big caboose
of yourn!&#8221; said a rough voice, &#8220;you take up
too much room,&#8221; and he wheeled the carriage
around so suddenly the babies almost toppled
over. &#8220;Other people want a chance. Get
along, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had no choice but to go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he sent off that nurse girl,&#8221; exclaimed
a woman with two children clinging
to her skirts. &#8220;Those great wagons are such
a nuisance!&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla crossed the street and went slowly
up and down. When the throng moved about
a little she could see the white fairy figures
floating over the greensward, and hear the
music that set one&#8217;s nerves a-tingle. The
outside crowd began to disperse, but the man
loitered about, so she did not dare go back.</p>
<p>Then they brought out some tables on the
lawn and began to arrange them. Oh, how
daintily pretty it was! She recognized some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
of the girls, and in spite of her courage,
sighed as she turned away.</p>
<p>Those were the sisters for whom the coach
and four waited, with the footman and
outriders, and who would be made welcome
at all the grand functions of life, while the
Cinderellas were relegated to the chimney
corner. And the godmother must come out of
fairy land, if she came at all, and transformed
one with a wand. That was why the glories
were so unsubstantial, and why the dream
must end at midnight.</p>
<p>The babies were clamoring for supper.
The house was all alone. She lifted them out
and helped them up the steps, then gave them
each a biscuit while she prepared their bread
and milk. The ladies came home from their
Whist. Mrs. Borden had won the first prize
and they were talking as eagerly as boys over
a baseball score. There was Jack, dirty and
tousled as any tramp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wash him up Marilla and put him in some
clean clothes or we&#8217;ll be late for dinner.
Come, be quick, child.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the portion of the Cinderellas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE LITTLE THORNS</h3>
</div>
<p>They were all very glad to be home again.
The house was so clean and orderly and there
were so many closets and drawers in which
to pack away things. Bridget had scoured
and scrubbed and polished windows largely to
pass away time, for the people next door had
been away as well and the maids on a vacation
earning money at seasides.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad to see you again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla was hugging Bridget and her tone
was full of delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, dear, an&#8217; it&#8217;s glad enough I am to get
ye back, but you&#8217;ve not grown very fat an&#8217;
rugged looking, but them babies do beat all!
They&#8217;re quite ginteel one may say, an how they
do run and talk! You&#8217;ll have your hands full,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, if they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to copy Jack!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bridget, they&#8217;re real sweet, only
they&#8217;re noisy when your head&#8217;s tired. It
sounds worse indoors. There was a big out
of doors and grass, and people passing and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
some children came in to play. But now you
have to look after them all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla! Marilla!&#8221;</p>
<p>No, she could not waste her time in the
chimney corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put on the babies&#8217; things and take them
out walking, they&#8217;ll drive me crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked them round to Loraine place.
Would she dare call? Oh, how her heart
yearned to see them all again! but the blinds
were drawn; perhaps no one was at home.</p>
<p>Then as they were going down the street,
just at the corner, a lady and two girls about
her size crossed. The lady and one of them
lived about a block further down Arch street.
The other she had known at the seaside.
She smiled with a sudden pleasant surprise.
The girl simply stared. Marilla&#8217;s face was
scarlet. Was it possible she was not to know
any of these girls if she should meet them?
This one did not live here, she knew that.</p>
<p>Then Aunt Hetty came home looking thinner
and more dried up than ever, but glad to
get back to her room. She would not come
down to dinner but M&#8217;rilla could bring her
up some toast and tea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>So instead of having a cozy time with
Bridget she carried the small waiter up stairs.
The tea was in the pot; Aunt Hetty had the
kettle boiling on the gas stove. The toast
was on a hot plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down a minute, I&#8217;ve hardly seen you.
Did you have a nice time? I suppose the
twins will be on the everlasting trot, now they
can walk so well, and as for talking&mdash;well I&#8217;m
glad I don&#8217;t have to live with them; that I&#8217;m
clear this end of the house. You see that they
don&#8217;t come up stairs. It&#8217;s nice to be in your
own place, though the folks where I staid were
very good and pleasant, I s&#8217;pose they thought
I might remember them in my will,&#8221; and she
gave a shrill sort of cackle. &#8220;Now I tell you
there isn&#8217;t much fun in living to be old, and I
seem to have lost my spunk. It&#8217;s just a kind
of drowsing life away. Now tell me what you
did! My, but this toast tastes good! Better
than all their flummery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there were a good many nice things
and pretty houses and gay people, and a big
place where they all went to meals. And Jack
is better than he used to be, he had the nicest
little playmate and was out of the house most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
of the time. But I must run down, for Bridget
said my dinner was ready. I&#8217;ll come up again
when the babies are in bed; can I bring you
anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, a glass of hot milk. No, bring
it in a cup with a handle&mdash;it is so much nicer
to hold. You&#8217;re a good willing girl, Marilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you never would get down,&#8221;
Bridget said, almost crossly. &#8220;If you have to
wait on that old woman and all the rest of us
you&#8217;ll wish you were in the grave. My! You
look all tired out. Now, here&#8217;s a nice bit of
chicken that I laid aside for you. I&#8217;m not
goin&#8217; to have you fed on leavings. And it
wasn&#8217;t nice down there?&#8221; nodding her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bridget, such a kitchen and such a table,
and no white cloth on it! They, the servants
didn&#8217;t seem to care, and they were nice and
clean at the Home, and you&#8217;re&mdash;well, you have
things as nice as in the dining room, and to
have things shoveled out of the kettle on your
plate or cold on a dish! Sometimes puddings
were good, and the creams and frozen
things were clean and nice. But I&#8217;m so glad
to get back to you. And the lovely bath
room! We didn&#8217;t have any in the cottage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Why it saves half the work taking care of
babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet it does, I couldn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t
live in such a muxy kitchen. If I couldn&#8217;t
have things to suit I&#8217;d take French leave,
though I guess I&#8217;d call it Irish leave. And
people, women, think it a fine thing to go off
and live that way. But the boss got very
tired of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla laughed faintly. She was almost
too tired to eat, but the chicken was so tasty,
and the fresh home-made bread delightful.
And the cheery voice put heart in the girl.
Then the dessert was delicious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised to take Aunt Hetty a cup of
milk. I&#8217;ll see first if Mrs. Borden wants me.
But I&#8217;ll dry the dishes for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear, I did the most of them while you
were up stairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The babies had been put to bed. They did
have an unlimited capacity for sleep, now that
they were well. Jack was perched on his
father&#8217;s knee detailing some wonderful adventures.
No, they did not need her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in next door awhile,&#8221; said
Bridget on her return. &#8220;Mrs. Dawson&#8217;s girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
left in a huff, and she asked me if I knew anyone.
And there was my friend, Maggie Brady,
just out of a place and a nice tidy girl; a good
cook, too. So they both suited. Maggie&#8217;s
mother and mine lived in the same town.
It&#8217;s nice to have a friend at hand. And when
ye&#8217;s through with the old lady I&#8217;d run to bed.
You look tired as a wagon wheel that&#8217;s run
round and round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla laughed and took a bottle of milk
with her. Aunt Hetty drank a good cupful,
hot, and the remainder was set out on the
window sill. Then she settled herself in bed
with two pillows under her head; she could
hear better she thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you open that book at the mark and
read to me. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t be very interesting, for
you can&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gone before. And no
doubt I&#8217;ll fall asleep&mdash;I always snore a little
at first, and when you hear that you may light
the burner in the other room and turn it very
low and put the window down from the top
and skip off to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was very tired but she read quite
awhile before the gentle snoring began, and
she was glad enough to go to bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>They had been home just a week when
school opened. It was a comfort to get rid of
Jack. They began to settle into quite regular
living.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just had a fright,&#8221; said Mrs. Borden,
coming up to her sister&#8217;s room. &#8220;A man has
been here inquiring about school children and
I <i>did</i> stretch the truth a little. You see, now
children have to go to school until they are
fourteen. I simply can&#8217;t let Marilla go. I
didn&#8217;t adopt her nor consider her in any sense
my own. A child like that isn&#8217;t worth more
than her board and clothes. What good
would she be to us if we had to get her off at
nine in the morning, and then have only an
hour in the afternoon. The twins <i>must</i> be
taken out, and there&#8217;s so much running up and
down. She&#8217;s a nice honest, truthful child and
a born nurse girl. But if I had to send her to
school, I&#8217;d trot her off to the Home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much to do this winter. When
you come to that, she knows enough for ordinary,
and later on she could go to evening
school. There&#8217;s so much shopping and planning,
and we must be out a good deal. The
twins mightn&#8217;t take to a new girl. Let us keep
her if we possibly can.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>Miss Borden&#8217;s lover was to return before
Christmas and wanted every thing ready for a
speedy marriage. It would be in church with
a very small reception afterward. And that
was hardly three months&#8217; distance.</p>
<p>Marilla was coming home with the babies
one afternoon when two lady callers and a
girl were saying adieu and coming down the
steps. Yes, that was Ada Brant who had been
at Bayside in the summer and at first had
been quite friendly with her. Now she looked
as if she had never known her.</p>
<p>Maybe that was the way all the girls would
feel to one who had been bound-out from an
institution. There they had all been on an
equality. And somehow the Bordens had not
really put her down. Then that lovely Miss
Armitage. Why, there had been a place for
her at the table, and Jane had waited on her as
if she had been a guest!</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be different now. Then
came a very bitter knowledge to Marilla
Bond. Five years more of this, and wouldn&#8217;t
people remember she had been Mrs. Borden&#8217;s
nursemaid? Why, even now she would be
glad to be Miss Armitage&#8217;s maid. What made
the difference?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>She was to hear more of it that evening.
After the babies came in from their outing
they were washed, undressed, and a nice warm
wrapper put over their nightgown, and then
fed. Afterward laid in their crib. They
didn&#8217;t go to sleep at once but kicked and laughed
and chatted in a regular frolic. Phlegmatic
babies can be easily trained. Then
Marilla came down and waited on the table as
Bridget sent various things up on the lift.
She was a really charming little waitress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such an odd thing occurred today,&#8221; began
Mrs. Borden. &#8220;John do you know a firm,
Davis &amp; Calthorpe, who manufacture something&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Calthorpe is selling out, I drew up
some papers for him. He&#8217;s been up in the
Adirondacks all summer and is going to
Bermuda; but he will never come back alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How queer it all is! We met Mrs. Brant
a few times at Bayside. They have come to
Newton to look into the business and are
staying with Mrs. Wheeler. They came to
call and Mrs. Brant has a pretty, stylish young
daughter. Of course they&#8217;ll have to move here.
She is quite taken with Newton. I told them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
about that Jamreth house down the street and
they decided to look at it. Of course I didn&#8217;t
get much acquainted with her, but she seems
a very nice body. And that&#8217;s a promising
business, but Calthorpe had to give it up and
I&#8217;m sorry for the poor fellow; glad, too, that he
met with this chance of disposing of his share.
Brant appears to be a nice, brisk fellow and it
is lucky for Davis as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Jamreth house had stood empty all
summer. Marilla passed it on her way to the
park, for Arch street led direct. Suppose Ada
was there sitting on the stoop or at the window
and giving her that indifferent stare when they
had been quite acquaintances!</p>
<p>For the first time fairy land and her dancing
with the Prince failed to comfort. The whole
world seemed changed, and how would Miss
Armitage be, now that she was well?</p>
<p>But she was very, very busy; Jack went to
school a week and was delighted with the
boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam Gordon has a little brother just big
enough to begin school. I wish one of the
twins was a boy. What&#8217;s the use of so many
girls?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>His father laughed a little at that. The
second week the charm began to fail. His
head ached and he wanted to stay at home and
have Marilla read to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys don&#8217;t have headaches,&#8221; said his
mother. But he was cross and his face flushed
up so that in the afternoon his teacher sent
him home. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t want this scratchy
flannel on! I like the other better; can&#8217;t I
pull it off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The others are worn out, and it is coming
cooler weather. Oh, you&#8217;ll get used to it,&#8221;
said his mother, teasingly.</p>
<p>Then he kicked the babies&#8217; playthings
about and pinched Marilla&#8217;s arm and wouldn&#8217;t
eat any dinner, and said his pudding was bitter.
His father sent him to bed, but he tossed and
tumbled and cried out for a drink ever so
many times, and in the morning was red with a
fever and some sort of eruption. So they
sent for Dr. Baker, who pronounced it a fine
case of measles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see where he caught it, unless it is
in the school, and I suppose the twins will have
it,&#8221; said Mrs. Borden in despair.</p>
<p>There were three pretty bad days and Jack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
tried the patience of the whole household
sorely. Then the babies showed symptoms
and seemed vexed that such a thing should
happen to them, and now school was not to be
thought of in some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run out and take a little airing, Marilla,&#8221;
said Mrs. Borden, late one afternoon. &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t been out of the house for days.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was very glad to go. Jack was still a
recluse though he seemed well.</p>
<p>Which way should she go? Her heart cried
softly for Loraine place and almost unconsciously
her feet turned thitherward. Miss
Armitage sat by the window but she sprang up
and opened the hall door with, &#8220;My dear,
dear child!&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla had her face in a transport of happy
crying, from an overweighted heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear!&#8221; leading her in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Armitage, we have the measles
round at our house. Perhaps I oughtn&#8217;t come
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I had the measles long ago, and I&#8217;ve
seen three cases this afternoon. I&#8217;ve only
been home four days and had the most splendid
time. But I want to hear about you&mdash;have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
you been well, and was it nice at the seaside?
Why it seems like a year since we parted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was well and the babies walk and
talk and are real cunning and they do grow
prettier. They&#8217;re getting some real nice hair
but I can&#8217;t make it curl. I didn&#8217;t like the
house so well and there was no bath only a cold
water faucet and a gas stove, and I missed
Bridget so much. We staid out of doors most
of the time. I didn&#8217;t go in bathing&mdash;I was a
little afraid, I think, and I would have had to
go with some of the servants. There were a
good many of them&mdash;we took our meals outside.
I was glad to get home, and oh, so glad
to see you!&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught the hand and kissed it rapturously.
Miss Armitage held up the face with
her hand under the chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you haven&#8217;t gained any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I did at first, but Jack was so
troublesome, and the old lady, Aunt Hetty,
wants one to read her to sleep and sometimes
it takes so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You surely are not helping with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, only reading and answering her bell.
She&#8217;s somehow so nice when you wait on her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
I think, like the rest of us, she&#8217;s so glad to be
back. One day she gave me a dollar and said
I must spend it for candy, but I haven&#8217;t yet.
Do you think I ought to have told Mrs.
Borden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, not necessarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so very fond of candy. There&#8217;s a
beautiful book of fairy stories in a store down
town that I&#8217;d like. Only Jack takes every
thing, and he keeps asking if I haven&#8217;t a penny
when we go out. His mother doesn&#8217;t give
him pennies to spend, and a very good thing,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of books do you read to the old
lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see it&#8217;s this way, she reads on
pages and pages and puts in a mark, then I go
on where she left off and so I don&#8217;t get the real
sense of the story. They seem to have a good
deal of trouble. I&#8217;d rather read about little
girls who went to their grandmother&#8217;s and had
nice times, and beautiful verses full of music
such as you used to read.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage laughed pleasantly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have some nice reading again. And you
ought to go to school.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you see I can&#8217;t. I look over Jack&#8217;s
books and I write on pieces of paper. I don&#8217;t
know how to spell all the words. Oh, I wrote a
letter to Dr. Richards. He asked me to, and
he sent such a nice answer. I did want to
write again, but I hadn&#8217;t any paper nor
postage stamp, and I didn&#8217;t like to ask the
second time. Oh, I might buy some with my
dollar, mightn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do you up a little package. He wants
to see you, so I&#8217;ll ask him to come here and let
you know. And sometimes when you are out
with the babies you must stop here and let
me see them, and I&#8217;ll call and see you all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how nice that will be. I&#8217;m so glad you
love me. For I never shall be like the girls
who have pretty homes and parents to love
them. But you&#8217;ll be the fairy godmother always,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; in a soft tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I must go. It&#8217;s so sweet to know
that some one really loves you even if you are
a bound-out girl. And now I&#8217;m beginning to
count the years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage kissed her and watched her
tripping down the steps. She was worthy of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
better fate. Would she love the hand that
set her in pleasanter places and not come to
think wholly of self? For she, woman past
thirty, as she was, longed for a little daughter&#8217;s
love, a daughter to grow up along side of her,
to share her very life.</p>
<p>The babies went out walking up and down
the block one day and took no harm. Violet
was wild to run away, as Jack had been, and
so was quite a care. Then the men came to
fumigate the house and they all went to a
friend&#8217;s and took lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, what a nice little maid you have,&#8221;
said the friend. &#8220;She seems to know just
what to do, and she&#8217;s so pleasant tempered.
Where did you find her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She came from Bethany Home and she&#8217;s
bound to me until she&#8217;s eighteen. She&#8217;ll be of
good service.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Autumn was glorious with a good deal
of sunshine; Jack went back to school and was
getting to be a regular boy, full of pranks; they
were sometimes rather rough. He did stand
in awe of his father, but he occasionally said
things to Marilla that were not a bit nice, then
he would coax her not to tell of them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>One afternoon Miss Armitage came. Bridget
said she was sorry the ladies were out but
the visitor said she wanted to see Marilla and
the babies and went up stairs to the nursery.
Playthings were all about; Marilla had been
building houses for the twins to knock down.
They glanced at Miss Armitage with wondering
eyes, but they said &#8220;down, down&#8221; when
Marilla took to a chair. Then they tumbled
over her and buried their hands in her curly
hair, even if it pulled. They showed they
owned her, and it really was not an easy lot for
the little girl. She did look pale and tired but
she was so glad to see her friend.</p>
<p>Then the lady began to plan if there was any
way to get her free. She went to see Mrs.
Johnson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the child seems very well off,&#8221; was
the rather tart reply. &#8220;She is well fed and
clothed and has nothing to do but amuse two
little ones. Many a girl would jump at the
place. It wouldn&#8217;t do for us to be changing
them about, you see. We do sometimes take
away a child who is ill treated. I&#8217;ve visited
this Mrs. Borden several times and found
things very satisfactory.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But she could be educated&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear lady, there are hundreds of these
poor children who need a good home and to
be fitted for their station in life which cannot
be a very high one. Their heads must not be
filled with dreams of wonderful fortunes.
Real work is and must be the lot of those
who are homeless and dependent. Now, if <i>you</i>
wanted to adopt some child I have two lovely
little girls here, one of them born to luxury it
would seem, but misfortune and death made
a waif of her. I do hope some well-to-do people
will take a fancy to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, she didn&#8217;t want any stranger. She
would wait and see. Why should she care so
much for Marilla? The faint little voice
haunted her&mdash;&#8220;Are you a fairy godmother?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bordens were really disappointed when
they found they had missed Miss Armitage.
Then a dressmaker was to come, and friends
were dropping in. Unless they shut the
nursery door the little girls were in everything,
and then they fairly howled for mama.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marilla, can&#8217;t you keep those children
entertained? It sounds as if they were getting
murdered. Put on their things and take them
out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>Then one night Pansy had the croup and
there was a great scare.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve let her get cold some way, Marilla;
you mustn&#8217;t let the wagon stand while
you keep looking at books and pictures in
store windows. You better go straight over
to the park, and don&#8217;t talk to other girls.
You&#8217;re old enough now to have a little judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla made the babies ready. They were
very fond of walking up and down stairs.
Now she lifted them in the carriage, tucked
them in with the pretty robe and they did
look picturesque in their fluffy white hoods
and fur cloaks. They uttered shrieks of delight
as they went along. The Brant&#8217;s were
moving in the Jamreth house; she would
remember hereafter to turn off at State street
and not pass it. Somehow she felt very tired.
At times there was such a fluttering somewhere
inside of her that for a moment things
went round and she had to gasp for breath.
She would like to tell Dr. Richards about it.
She had seen him twice, both times in the
street and it had kept her happy for days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>ON THE BORDER OF TRAGEDY</h3>
</div>
<p>For two days Jack had been out of school
with a sore throat. Today it was better. The
ladies wanted to go out to match some trimming
and view some elegant new party frocks
that might do for a wedding gown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t tear the house down while we
are gone. And if you are good Jack, I&#8217;ll bring
you home that new top you wanted. Remember
the noise disturbs Aunt Hetty.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the children enjoyed the noise. Aunt
Hetty&#8217;s bell rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marilla, can&#8217;t you keep those children
in a little better order,&#8221; said the fretful voice.
&#8220;And get me a drink of cold tea, I feel so
queer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; answered the child, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
try my best. If only Jack wasn&#8217;t home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was throwing the ball at the babies
who made vague efforts to catch it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so afraid you&#8217;ll hurt them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you old fraid cat! You can&#8217;t let a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
fellow have any fun! I&#8217;ll give it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a heavy ball but he sent it with
all his angry might. It struck against her
heart and she went down in a little heap.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fixed you that time! Come, you can&#8217;t
play possum over me, get up!&#8221;</p>
<p>He touched her with his foot. Pansy ran
and fell over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, you little clumsy skunk! You&#8217;ll
half kill her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Illa. Det up, Illa. Did bad Jack
hurt &#8217;ou?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack turned her partly over. Her face was
ghastly, with the eyes rolled up.</p>
<p>Aunt Hetty&#8217;s bell rang. Jack ran down
stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, come up Bridget, Marilla&#8217;s killed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, now you want to frighten a body out
of her wits! You ought to be skinned alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come quick!&#8221; Jack began to cry.</p>
<p>Bridget walked up stairs very deliberately,
&#8220;Oh, Holy Mother of God! Get up, children.
Marilla, dear&mdash;Oh, what have you done to
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the limp figure in her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, me darlint! Wurra! wurra! And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
that bell! As if no one wanted anything but
that old body with one foot in the grave. Jack
run in next door and ask Mrs. Seymour to
come at once; quick, or I&#8217;ll bat you with a
stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she went up stairs. The poor old
body was lying in the reclining chair, her face
distraught with fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send for the doctor at once, something has
happened to me, I can&#8217;t stir. My legs are
heavy as lead. Where&#8217;s Marilla? I&#8217;ve rung
and rung!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla&#8217;s fainted dead away. Yes, I&#8217;ll get
the doctor,&#8221; and down Bridget flew to open
the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh for the love of heaven, will you come
and talk to that thing in the wall an&#8217; get the
doctor! Why, I&#8217;m most crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what doctor?&#8221; Mrs. Seymour went to
the telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Baker, and then to Miss Armitage
in Loraine place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Baker would come at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found the lady&#8217;s number. She was
just going out but would stop there first.</p>
<p>Then she took Mrs. Seymour through to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
nursery. The children were patting and petting
Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away, children, you&#8217;ve had her smothered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she faint often? She seems so well
and merry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did that time last summer. She was
out with the babies and fell off of a stoop, I
believe, an&#8217; she kept looking like a ghost for
ever so long. That Miss Armitage took her
to her house an&#8217; took care of her. She&#8217;s a
good woman, that she is. An&#8217; it&#8217;s just my
belief that Marilla isn&#8217;t strong enough for
the rough an&#8217; tumble of life. Some ain&#8217;t
you know, an&#8217; she&#8217;s tugged these fat babies
about often; there isn&#8217;t but one nurse kept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they were too heavy for her to lift.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Borden didn&#8217;t want her to, much.
I&#8217;ll say that for her. She was afraid the babies
backs might get out of shape some way by a
bad fall. She&#8217;s a fair dealin&#8217; woman or I
wouldn&#8217;t have staid with her all these years.
But Marilla isn&#8217;t strong enough for the work,
and the old Aunt wants a good deal of waiting
on. It&#8217;s run up an&#8217; down until you&#8217;d think
her legs would just fall out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Seymour had been trying various
restoratives. Now Marilla gave a long shuddering
sigh, opened her eyes but closed them
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;What beautiful long lashes she has! And
such silky hair&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the saints be praised! I began to
think she was dead! Poor darlint! &#8217;Rilla
dear&mdash;its Bridget who&#8217;d do anything in the
world for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Baker arrived. He entered the room,
looked at Marilla, felt of her pulse, and listened
to the faint heart beats. &#8220;Give her a little
brandy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Mrs. Borden?
I thought the old lady&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she is!&#8221; interrupted Bridget, &#8220;she can&#8217;t
stir her legs one bit. She&#8217;s rale poorly, now I
tell you, an&#8217; this child&#8217;s been looking after her
as well as the babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s twice too much.&#8221; He ran lightly
up the stairs to meet with a torrent of up-braidings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d have to die here all alone!
Where&#8217;s Marilla? I&#8217;ve rung and rung.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl has been in a dead faint. She&#8217;s
worn out. And you must have a regular
nurse.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; Aunt Hetty began to cry,
&#8220;couldn&#8217;t I have her? &#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be as bad as
them two young ones. And I&#8217;d pay her well,
too. She&#8217;s so nice and good tempered with
her face full of smiles and sunshine. Oh, if
she&#8217;s going to be ill what shall we all do?&#8221;</p>
<p>The brandy revived Marilla a little. She
tried to speak but her lips felt stiff. They took
her up carefully and laid her on the old lounge.
The babies started to climb up over her at
once, and howled fearfully when Bridget
pulled them down with an ungentle shake and
sat them on the floor. Then she went to
answer the door bell and ushered in Miss
Armitage.</p>
<p>Dr. Baker came down at the same moment.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you shut those children up in some
dungeon? They&#8217;ve voices like a foghorn.
Ah, Miss Armitage. How is this patient?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m&mdash;better,&#8221; raising up suddenly then
falling back in a half faint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stir, keep as still as you can. You&#8217;ve
no strength to throw away on make believes.
See here, babies,&#8221; and he disgorged a paper of
peppermints that at once soothed broken
hearts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When will Mrs. Borden return?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;ll be home to dinner,&#8221; and Bridget
grinned. &#8220;Things were all well enough
when she went out. You see there&#8217;s some
weddin&#8217; fixings goin&#8217; on, and sure Miss Borden
deserves a good husband when she&#8217;s waited
five years. How&#8217;s the old lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty bad with her, though there&#8217;s
no immediate signs of her dying. But it&#8217;s
paralysis. Her limbs are cold and useless and
I think it is creeping up her left side. She&#8217;ll
be another baby added to the family, unless
she will go to a hospital which would be far
better for her. She must have a steady nurse.
I&#8217;ve been rather afraid of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go and see to my dinner. Miss Armitage
won&#8217;t you stay until the ladies come
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage signified her willingness and
laid aside her hat.</p>
<p>The babies were fairly gorging themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in again presently. I&#8217;ll leave this
for the child, to be given every half hour and
she is to lie perfectly still.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage smiled down in the pallid
face. It had grown quite thin again, but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
seemed to hold an ethical sweetness. Marilla
put out one slim hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems too bad the old lady should be
taken ill at this juncture,&#8221; said Mrs. Seymour.
&#8220;And Manila&#8217;s been such a faithful child.
She&#8217;s been growing tall this summer and autumn
and I suppose has run ahead of her
strength. Then with the two children to look
after&mdash;well a little nurse girl has rather hard
lines&mdash;they seldom have more than one, or if
they do the others are older. My two boys
are in boarding school. I&#8217;ve wished one was a
girl, they are so much more company for the
mother. But I&#8217;d wanted <i>her</i> to be pretty,&#8221;
she cast a sidelong glance at the twins. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a pity Jack should have taken all the beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twins felt so comfortable over the candy
that they went to playing with their blocks.
Miss Armitage gave her patient the second
dose of her medicine and she closed her eyes.</p>
<p>There was almost a shriek as Bridget opened
the hall door with&mdash;&#8220;the merciful saints
preserve us! Has Jack been run over by one
of them fury things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was crying and the blood was streaming
from his nose all over his blouse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been fighting, the bad boy, with a
nasty, dirty tramp!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bridget in her inmost heart hoped he had
the worst of it. &#8220;Whist!&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;there&#8217;s two sick folks in the house, the doctor&#8217;s
been an&#8217; he&#8217;s coming again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick! Oh, what has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the old lady&#8217;s had a stroke, an&#8217;
Marilla had a bad faint again. I thought sure
she was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden dropped into the hall chair and
began to cry hysterically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, go straight up to the bath room,&#8221; said
his aunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the neighbors came in, Mrs. Seymour
to talk through that funnel, and then Miss
Armitage and the doctor,&#8221; went on Bridget.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity one can&#8217;t stir out of the house
without something happening,&#8221; sobbed the
mistress. &#8220;And we&#8217;re both so tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There dear, come up stairs.&#8221; Florence
took Mrs. Borden by the arm, and they ascended
together. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll go and look after
Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put a big apron over her dress. Jack
sat on the bath room floor crying.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get up and take off those dirty things.
Come, your father will soon be home and I
don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;ll do to you,&#8221; said his
aunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;He may strap me if he likes, but I ain&#8217;t
going to be called a snotnosed scabby sneak of
a devil&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! hush! I won&#8217;t listen to such a
talk&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;And he slapped me in the face, and I
kicked his shins good, and then we fit and I
give him a punch in the belly and a good
bunk in the eye&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop Jack, I won&#8217;t hear another word.
Let me get you washed up. There comes your
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s nose had stopped bleeding and he was
washed and put in some clean clothes. Mrs.
Borden laid aside her wrap and hat and went
through to the nursery. The peppermint must
have been a sedative to nerves and stomach
for the twins looked up with an angelic smile
and went on house building. Mrs. Seymour
made the explanations.</p>
<p>&#8220;What could Marilla have been doing?
She was well enough when we went out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Miss Armitage gave the hand she held a
gentle squeeze and she saw the eyelids quiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I am very much obliged to you
both. I was sorry to miss you that day you
called, Miss Armitage. Oh dear, how you
must have been frightened! And poor Aunt
Hetty! Is it really true&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor couldn&#8217;t tell the absolute
danger so soon&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think it has been coming on some
time. She&#8217;s dragged her feet and she had a
quick, almost spiteful way of walking, if one
may call it that. She protested against
people slouching round without animation
enough to lift their feet. And some days she
wouldn&#8217;t come down to any meal. Well,
she&#8217;s a pretty old lady; we&#8217;ve always let her
have her way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack came into the room rather meek but
a handsome little fellow in spite of a lump on
his forehead. He had run out of doors without
waiting to hear the result of Marilla&#8217;s fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Captain!&#8221; said his father, holding out
his hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Seymour went home after proffering
her services if she should be needed through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
the night. The dinner bell rang and Miss
Borden insisted the guest must go down to
dinner and she would stay with the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re having our dinner a little late this
evening on account of a guest; otherwise I
would accept. I can stay half an hour longer.
Then if you won&#8217;t mind my coming around
about nine to hear the doctor&#8217;s verdict.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are very sympathetic. Thank
you. I only hope Marilla won&#8217;t have a bad
time as she did last summer. Why she&#8217;s
never fainted since.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack behaved beautifully at the table. No
one spoke of the fight. But he kept up a
shivery thought of wondering if the ball he had
thrown at Marilla had really hurt her. It
wasn&#8217;t a hard ball, at least not as hard as they
had sometimes in the street.</p>
<p>No one appeared very hungry. Mrs. Borden
went up to look after Aunt Hetty who
seemed disinclined to talk and only wanted a
cup of tea. Mr. Borden looked at Marilla
who had fallen asleep. Then he went through
to the other room and took Jack on his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s hear about the fight,&#8221; he said,
but his voice didn&#8217;t seem very stern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>Jack really wanted to cry. He felt sort of
bruised and beaten though he had knocked
down his adversary and would have stamped
on him if his mother had not appeared at that
moment and carried him off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see&#8221;&mdash;and the boy winked very
hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who begun it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that Patsy&#8217;s a reg&#8217;lar bum! He&#8217;s
called me names&mdash;he plays hookey too, and
he tried to trip me up and I give him a left-hander,
and he called me a stinking pup and
ever so many nasty names and then we went
at it. Papa, you may strap me if you want
to, but if I hadn&#8217;t fit the boys would have
made fun of me and called me sissy, and we
went at it like fury. He made my nose bleed,
and I guess I gave him a black eye; and I
kicked his shins&mdash;he&#8217;s got fat legs. He&#8217;s just
a bounder and teacher said he&#8217;d wind up in
the reform school. I just wish he would!&#8221; with
an angry zest.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do boys learn such shocking talk?&#8221;
asked Aunt Florence, &#8220;When they never hear
it at home, and as for fighting&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in the outside air and perhaps like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
measles runs through boyhood. Jack, I want
you to stand up for yourself though I don&#8217;t
admire street fights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I won&#8217;t be called nasty names, and he
said I was a sneak of a devil&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try and keep out of the way of such boys.
But if you <i>must</i> fight stand up to it boldly.
I think you didn&#8217;t get the worst of it, but I
guess it&#8217;s good your mother came along just
then, and now little boy you had better go to
bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was very glad nothing had been asked
him about Marilla. He was tired and drowsy.
But Aunt Florence said, &#8220;Jack I think you
were a very bad boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Baker came in and took another look at
Marilla whose pulse was still very fluttering.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose it is?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Borden, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The child has a weak heart. Perhaps no
organic disease at present, and if she gets
through the next two or three years safely all
may go well with her. But she ought not
have any severe strain. Do you know anything
about her family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t any, I took her from that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
Bethany Home. She&#8217;s a nice, willing, pleasant
girl and a splendid hand with babies. But
she was with Miss Armitage all through that
awful time we had with the children teething,
and the babies <i>are</i> good. I resolved I&#8217;d never
make children so troublesome as Jack was,
waiting on them hand and foot. I&#8217;ve had a
different system with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The system seems to have worked well,
but I think you need a stronger nursemaid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never let her lift them, I knew it was
not safe for them,&#8221; laughing. &#8220;Though think
how poor children carry babies about; but now
tell me about Aunt Hetty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is the beginning of the end. You
can&#8217;t quite tell, but she&#8217;s pretty well worn out
with the years, and she must have a steady
nurse. A hospital would be best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we will talk that over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any one for tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Is it as bad as that?&#8221; and Mrs. Borden
turned pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should advise an emergency nurse for a
week or so; by that time you can make some
plans.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Vanderveer was comfortable, but she
did not want to be left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it dreadful, Florence, that this
should happen just now. If it only could have
waited until Christmas,&#8221; Mrs. Borden said
with tears in her eyes. &#8220;I meant you should
have such a happy wedding. You&#8217;ve always
been like an own sister to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t worry tonight. Only&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage came in and heard the story
through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me telephone at once to the nurses&#8217;
home, then you will feel relieved. And perhaps
it would be a good thing to send Marilla
to me for a little while again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot do without a nurse girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a week or two may restore Marilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nurse came, a wholesome middle aged
body who had been for weeks with a helpless
paralytic. And so the midnight found them
all comfortable. Marilla was left on the
lounge. Miss Armitage sat a long while in her
soft wrapper planning about the child she felt
she must rescue. Oh, she <i>did</i> want her. She
did not try to give any reason for the love that
had stolen almost unaware in her heart, or the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
faith that this child would not disappoint her.
Every year she was growing older, every year
she longed more for some one of her very own.
Why should she not play fairy godmother in
earnest? She must have Dr. Richard&#8217;s verdict.</p>
<p>For Mrs. Borden with many kindly qualities
looked at matters only as they applied to
herself. When Marilla was eighteen she would
come to the freedom of a bound-out girl, too
old to begin another life, settled in a rut&mdash;if she
lived. Was she not one of the little ones that
might be rescued and live out a higher life?
There were many who could not, but she felt
she must go carefully.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes proved an admirable nurse and
Aunt Hetty took to her in an astonishing manner.
She was attractive to the children, as well,
who greeted her with a smile.</p>
<p>On the next day Dr. Baker admitted the
paralysis was gaining rapidly and thought she
could not last long. That evening she said to
the nurse, &#8220;Send Mr. Borden up here, and you
stay down with the ladies.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came up and greeted her cordially, hoping
for better things, as friends are wont to
say.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, John, there will not be any better, so
we won&#8217;t indulge in make believes. Carry and
James were quite sure this way of living wasn&#8217;t
good for me. They wanted me to buy a house
and make it over to them and they would care
for me the rest of my life. I&#8217;ve lived with
Carry, paid her good board, too, so I knew what
that would be. I couldn&#8217;t live quite alone,
you see&mdash;I always wanted some one round that
I could see if I wanted to. Old people do get
queer. So when I had to foreclose here I made
you this offer. You&#8217;re the only one of them
all who has not asked me outright for money,
and I honor you for it. Your mortgage here is
twenty-three hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said with a vague sort of hope that
she wasn&#8217;t going to ask him to settle it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to get it cancelled; I&#8217;ll give you
the order. I&#8217;ve meant to do this the last
year. Carry worried so at me that I went
away with her and felt none the better for it.
I&#8217;d rather staid at home with Bridget. So you
see to that at once. And I want to make a
new will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Hetty! Well, I don&#8217;t know what to
say,&#8221; and his tone showed his surprise. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
say anything.&#8221; She gave her little cackle of a
laugh that always had a sound of derision in
it. &#8220;You know I can&#8217;t take any of it with me,
and I&#8217;d like to know it will make few people
pleased and happy. I&#8217;m going to make you
executor, so get some one else to write out the
will. I fixed it to my liking today. You&#8217;ve
all been very good to put up with my whims
and queernesses. Old people don&#8217;t like too
much advice, especially where money is concerned.
Look in the second drawer there&mdash;in
a long envelope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for this expression of your satisfaction.
The babies and Jack may have
been a nuisance at times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that little girl&#8217;s been good enough to
make up for any annoyance&mdash;not that there&#8217;s
been much. Jack&#8217;s a smart, funny little fellow.
You know they&#8217;re all more or less bad,
but they grow up pretty fair. There now, I&#8217;m
tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Borden wished her a kindly good-night
and went down stairs to recount the wonderful
interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, John!&#8221; Mrs. Borden leaned her head
down on her husband&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;What a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
streak of good fortune! Now we really do
own the house free and clear, I thought our
summering would be quite moderate but it
wasn&#8217;t. Still it did the babies an immense deal
of good after they got over their awful time.
And they&#8217;re so nice and well now, and are
growing better looking all the time. If Marilla
only <i>could</i> make their hair curl! It&#8217;s so
stringy, and we haven&#8217;t worried at Aunt
Hetty for what she did or what she didn&#8217;t do,
and weren&#8217;t snappy when she found fault. I
used to think she needn&#8217;t have rung for Marilla
quite so much, but the child never minded
running up and down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How has she been today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t just know; Dr. Baker said
she must keep pretty still, so she&#8217;s laid on the
old lounge, but the babies would crawl over
her. It does seem as if we must have someone
else&mdash;an older person, though some of them
object to taking out children. But if we want
to get much sewing done&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll have a seamstress for a week or
so,&#8221; said Aunt Florence, &#8220;time goes on so
fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla had gone up stairs to her own bed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
where Bridget had crooned over her in tender
Irish fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;m sore afraid them babies&#8217;ll be the
death of you, poor lamb! They drag on you
so, and their chatter would drive me crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re so funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t call it funny with their hundred and
fifty wants,&#8221; sniffed Bridget.</p>
<p>Marilla turned faint now and then but for
several days she was not sent out with the
children. Miss Armitage came over every day
to inquire about both invalids. Mrs. Vanderveer
dozed a good deal and the numbness
seemed crawling further up her body.</p>
<p>&#8220;She may have another stroke and she may
go just this way,&#8221; said Mrs. Holmes, &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t give her more than a month at the
longest. I&#8217;ve seen it so many times. But it
is merciful for them not to last years.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was mid-October then. The seamstress
proved a treasure. Garments were completed
and laid away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want most of the work finished up in
November,&#8221; said Mrs. Borden, &#8220;then we can
plan all the other matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to look up some one else. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
want a nurse to take up the children in the
morning and wash and dress them, and they
must go out. They&#8217;re losing all their lovely
weather. Marilla doesn&#8217;t seem to get along
at all. If she&#8217;s going to develop some heart
trouble she will just be good for nothing. Of
course, when I took her she seemed healthy
enough, and it was the best thing to do then.
John has had some good luck this fall and we
don&#8217;t need to think of saving up money for the
mortgage. I could afford a regular nurse, and
it would ease me up so much. I don&#8217;t suppose
they&#8217;d take Marilla back at the Home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to John about it if; we <i>could</i> find a
new place for her. Why, she would make a
nice little waitress. If you could keep three
girls,&#8221; laughingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, we must not spread out too rapidly,
and somehow I&#8217;d hate to give her up.
She trains the children so nicely. And have
you noticed how sort of gentlemanly Jack is
growing toward her? He was real rude.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack had experienced many qualms of conscience
about throwing the ball that day, but
Marilla made no reference to it. Still she
might tell Bridget, she and Bridget were such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
cronies, and Bridget would make an awful
fuss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla,&#8221; he said one night when she was
getting him ready for bed&mdash;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to
hurt you that day with the ball&mdash;you know.
I didn&#8217;t think girls were so tender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was tired and there had been something
stopping my breath like, now and then, maybe
it wasn&#8217;t the ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were good not to tell on a fellow. I&#8217;ll
never, never hurt you again, nor pinch you,
nor be ugly to you. You&#8217;re so sweet, Marilla,&#8221;
and he clasped his arms around her
neck, kissing her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE ARK OF LOVE</h3>
</div>
<p>The glowing golden October weather had
given place to several lowering days. Furnaces
and grates were started up, and overcoats
brought out, and pedestrians hurried
along. Even children did not stop to play, for
now a cold drizzle had set in.</p>
<p>It was very warm and cheery in Miss Armitage&#8217;s
library. There was a fire in the grate,
a pot of beautiful red carnations on one stand,
a great vase of roses on the other, and a
dainty tea table set out with Wedgewood.
Thursday afternoon she was always at home.
From some cause there had been very few in.
Jane came and put two big lumps of cannel
coal on the fire and said a few words, then went
to answer the ring at the door; it was Dr.
Richards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Will you
please light a burner or two?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, let us sit in this mysterious light
and watch the blaze leaping over and around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
those black hillocks. Have you been busy today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very. Some days I don&#8217;t feel in a
working humor. I had only two calls this
afternoon. Will you have a cup of tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; when have you been to the Bordens?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how are the invalids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Vanderveer is sinking in a comatose
state; she doesn&#8217;t suffer, which <i>is</i> a great blessing
toward the last. As for Marilla&#8221;&mdash;she made
a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8221; inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not satisfied, she has such a blue, tired
look. But she is about as usual. Dr. Richards,
I want her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in the tone touched him. It
seemed the cry of motherhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, wouldn&#8217;t they give her up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think they would; a friend came to
see if they did not want her nursemaid, a nice
well trained girl of twenty; an excellent seamstress.
She is going to California. Mrs.
Borden told me this as we were down in the
hall. Dr. Baker said something about the
child&#8217;s health that rather startled her. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
before we could have any discussion another
visitor called. She thinks Marilla doesn&#8217;t
have anything much to do; but the babies are
a constant care. They want to be entertained
every minute of the time. Violet is developing
quite a temper and slaps her little nurse.
All her mother said was &#8216;Violet, that&#8217;s naughty.&#8217;
But you should have seen Pansy speak some
Mother Goose rhymes. Marilla had been
training her. The gestures, the roll of the
eyes, the coquettish turn of the head was the
daintiest thing you ever saw. Then she repeated&mdash;&#8216;Where
are you going, my pretty
maid?&#8217; and she had a little milk pail on her
arm, and she managed to keep the two parts
wonderfully distinct&mdash;it was remarkable in a
child not three years old, and when she said&mdash;&#8216;Then
I won&#8217;t marry you, my pretty maid&#8217;
and answered so pertly&mdash;&#8216;Nobody asked you,
sir, she said,&#8217; it would have done credit to an
exhibition. Her mother sprang up and kissed
her rapturously, crying&mdash;&#8216;Isn&#8217;t she the dearest
and sweetest thing and the smartest! Think
of her learning that and acting it off so completely,
and not three years old! She is
smarter than Violet&#8217;&mdash;and then Violet set up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
such a howl! Her mother pacified her by
saying Marilla should tell her a piece, and after
several efforts Cinderella did induce her to say
by a great deal of prompting &#8216;Milkman, Milkman,
where have you been?&#8217; Think of the
wear on the child&#8217;s nerves, and she looked so
tired. I really couldn&#8217;t stand it a moment
longer. They think she has nothing to do
but just amuse those two strong irrepressible
children who climb over her and torment her
in every fashion. I can&#8217;t stand it. I hardly
slept last night thinking of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you bring her over for a visit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of proposing that. If I could persuade
her to transfer the child to me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if she gets another nurse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I must try. The strain on her is too
great, and now for almost a week she has not
been out of the house; Mrs. Borden bewails
it for the childrens&#8217; sake. She thinks only of
them with a mother&#8217;s selfishness, and she
doesn&#8217;t give Marilla credit for these pretty
ways or their intelligence. She is just their nurse
girl. It is a cruel waste of the child&#8217;s gifts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see Dr. Baker; most of all I&#8217;d
like to see Marilla, but it wouldn&#8217;t be etiquette
to call.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go tomorrow with courage enough to
have a gentle talk or a straight out one,&#8221; said
Miss Armitage resolutely. &#8220;We try to save
other lives, why not this one? And this one is
dear to me. It has so much of promise in it,
and life gets lonely sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He longed to come into it, but he kept his
promise. Until she made some sign he must
be content with friendship. He rose abruptly
and said he must be going. She did not detain
him.</p>
<p>It was raining a-softly now and he hurried
along. His office was in a little ell part in a
rather inviting looking house, and he took his
meals with the tenant. The office boy was on
the lookout for him, it was time he went
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a gentleman in there waiting for
you,&#8221; he said with his good-night.</p>
<p>The gentleman was comfortably ensconced
in the Morris chair, smoking a cigar. Doctor
Richards took a second look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lorimer!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Where
have you dropped from? I haven&#8217;t seen you
in an age&mdash;but I&#8217;m glad, old fellow; I was feeling
rather down; I should have had a gay
presentiment.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Remembering old times when we were
both bloated aristocrats, favorites with the
gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And are now earning daily bread,&#8221; laughed
the doctor. &#8220;At least I am and trying to help
suffering humanity. Isn&#8217;t that neatly put?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I can claim all that;
now and then I get some poor fellow&#8217;s affairs
out of a snarl and make him pay for it, and one
end of something has drifted here to Newton
and I&#8217;m after that, but I thought I&#8217;d hunt you
up first. I&#8217;ve been here a good half hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And supper is ready in the house. Then
we will have a good hour before any one drops
in. Come in,&#8221; and he opened a side door into
a hall.</p>
<p>There were three persons at the table, an
elderly couple and a woman in the thirties.
They made Mr. Lorimer cordially welcome
and the supper was inviting. The guest
asked some questions about Newton which
was a quiet rather old fashioned town quite
set in its ways.</p>
<p>Afterward they settled themselves comfortably
in the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to hunt up some one&mdash;do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
know anything about a Bethany Home for
orphans, girls, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Richards roused from his lazy position.
&#8220;Yes, I know about it, though I never been
on the staff. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to learn about a child placed there
four or five years ago. Let me see,&#8221; referring
to a memorandum, &#8220;name, Marilla Bond;
mother and father died in this town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla Bond. Yes. I know the child.
What of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll begin at the very first. Hardly two
years ago Peter Schermerhorn died at the age
of ninety-eight. He was the black sheep of an
otherwise respectable family, went off and
spent his portion in riotous living, afterward
bought a tract of ground above Harlem, turned
hermit, raised geese and ducks and pigs,
married and had three daughters and they in
turn married, glad, I suppose, to get away from
the penurious living. So it went on. He had
to give up the pigs and geese, did a little gardening
and two years ago died without a will.
Oddly enough he had kept a family record
which has been of great service to us. The old
shanty was a disgrace, the ground valuable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
The city was bringing up one of its fine
avenues and a syndicate made a proffer for the
land. Of course the heirs soon scented this
out, and our firm has been trying to settle
the estate so the property can be turned into
money, and a good deed given. We have
found about everybody, I believe, but the
mother of this child who is in very direct
descent, eluded us a long while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this child is one of the heirs?&#8221; in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Her mother came here after her
marriage. The father was killed in some
machinery mishap. The mother was in a
store, a bakery, I believe, and dying, gave her
little girl to the friend she had lived with,
and the friend married and went out to Easton.
We found she did not take the child with her
but put her in this Bethany Home with some
important papers. So we want the child and
the papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The child was twelve, a year ago September.
She was bound-out to some fairly nice
people as a little nursemaid. And an heiress!&#8221;
in a tone of glad surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well not to any great extent. There are a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
good many heirs it seems&mdash;ten thousand or so.
But we had to know whether she was living
or not on account of the title.&#8221;</p>
<p>His little Cinderella! Truly this was a
fairy story. &#8220;Oh, are you <i>quite</i> sure?&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s no doubt, if she is the true heir.
But the woman at Easton attested a very
straight story and knew of the husband&#8217;s
death, though she had not known him personally.
The money is on the mother&#8217;s side,
you see, so his death is neither here nor there.
And now&mdash;can&#8217;t we go out and interview this
place and the keeper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly tonight. The matron is a rather
rigid person I believe. We had best tackle her
by daylight, and the child is almost in this
vicinity. A rather unusual child I think, very
sweet natured. Oh, I can&#8217;t express all my
delight. She is the kind of girl that ought to
be educated, that should live in an atmosphere
of love, and she is not really strong enough to
take the rough and tumble of life. Oh, I can&#8217;t
tell you how glad I am.&#8221; Lorimer surveyed his
friend with a rather humorous smile. They
had been chums during a summer in Switzerland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
and Holland, but he had not thought
Richards much given to either love or romance.</p>
<p>Then they branched off into old times when
both had been rather wasteful. Lorimer was
working hard to redeem that youthful extravagance;
Dr. Richards cared nothing at all
for the moneyed end of life.</p>
<p>He would fain have kept his friend all night
but Lorimer had engaged his room at a hotel.
They were to meet as soon as possible in the
morning.</p>
<p>Bethany Home was quite in the suburbs,
reached by a walk after one had left the
trolley. The house was a big rambling place
to which there had been made several additions.
It had been a gift from a benevolently
disposed woman, with a small endowment
that was occasionally added to. There was
quite a spacious garden and an abundance of
rose vines.</p>
<p>Yes, Mrs. Johnson was in and they were
ushered into a large old fashioned apartment,
scrupulously neat and formal. Mrs. Johnson
was a somewhat portly woman turned of
sixty, whose face had settled into severe lines,
and she eyed her visitors rather suspiciously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am Dr. Richards,&#8221; he began with a
softening of the countenance, &#8220;and my friend
Mr. Lorimer is a lawyer from New York who
comes on a matter of business concerning a
little girl who was an inmate of the Home until
a little over a year ago&mdash;Marilla Bond.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8221;&mdash;in a rather questioning manner.</p>
<p>Lorimer told his story and the surprise in
the woman&#8217;s face was evident.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is of most importance is to learn
whether there are any papers to substantiate
the claim. One has to be careful in the legal
matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed to consider. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; rather
reluctantly. &#8220;The person who brought her
here gave quite a box of papers and some
trinkets to my safe keeping. We take charge
of them until the girls are eighteen&mdash;then they
have served out their time and are legally their
own mistresses. Ours is quite a private institution
and has no connection with the city,
although it has a board of officers, of which I
am president. Of course I keep watch over
the girls who are bound-out. This Marilla
has a very nice place. She was away all summer
with the family. One of our managers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
visited this Mrs. Borden on her return and
found everything satisfactory and the child
content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could we look over the papers?&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed rather loth to produce them but
she could find no excuse. She recalled the
fact that she had seen Dr. Richards&#8217; name in
connection with the Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p>
<p>Certainly there was enough to substantiate
the claim. A marriage certificate, an attestation
of the baby&#8217;s birth, and old Dr. Langdon
was still alive, though he had retired from
practice. A packet of letters as well, two
notices of Mr. Bond&#8217;s accident and death.
Everything was ready for corroboration.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorimer gathered up the important
papers. At first Mrs. Johnson rather demurred
about his taking them away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I would have no object in destroying
them. I should not be the gainer by it. And
this is the last heir we have to trace. Now we
can proceed to a settlement. The syndicate
takes more than half the property and pays
cash. The remainder can be easily sold. No
one seems disposed to demand an extravagant
price. You will hear from me before long, and
I will return the papers.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>After they had settled that and left the lady,
Lorimer said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let us interview this Doctor Langdon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was a somewhat feeble, white haired old
man but received them very graciously and
was much interested in the story. Turning
to his book he refreshed his memory. Yes,
there was the birth of the child. The mother
he put down as rather delicate. A note some
time after substantiated the accident and
death of the father. He was very willing to
give an affidavit. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been a tremendous
help to me, Al,&#8221; said Mr. Lorimer, &#8220;estates
that have to be settled this way are an enormous
bother, and thanks are poor pay,&#8221;
laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I shall demand something more.
The child will need a guardian. She has
several warm friends here, I&#8217;m not willing to
lose sight of her. So I shall ask that office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;why not? Some one must act until
she is of age. Yes, I&#8217;ll remember. I&#8217;m glad
you spoke of it. I&#8217;ll be up again. Indeed
I&#8217;m quite curious to see how she takes her fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the friends parted. Dr. Richards made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
several calls, stopped for some lunch, found a
number of patients awaiting him and a message
that had come from Miss Armitage, who
wished to see him at once. She had had quite
an eventful morning as well. Some vague
presentiment had haunted her about Marilla
and after disposing of a few business calls she
hurried around to Arch street.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borden answered the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Armitage! We&#8217;re so full of
trouble! Aunt Hetty has just died and
Marilla&mdash;oh, I don&#8217;t know what will become of
the child!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is not ill?&#8221; in a tone of anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come in and sit down and let me tell
you. They thought the first part of the night
the poor old lady was dropping off quietly.
Then toward morning she seemed to rally, and
kept calling for Marilla. John had been up
there most of the time and he said bring the
child up. We didn&#8217;t suppose she was really
conscious. So Marilla went up. It was daylight,
and just as soon as she went to the bedside
the poor old lady held out both hands, and
Mrs. Holmes said she really smiled, and then
a horrible thing happened, like a fit, and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
mouth all curled up and her eyes rolled up to
the whites and Marilla screamed and fainted
and the old lady was dead in a minute, and
then the child fainted several times and they
put her in her own bed&mdash;we&#8217;d had her down
stairs. What did your doctor say about her
last summer? Dr. Baker said her heart was
weak. Now I think they oughtn&#8217;t have sent
a girl out from the Home who had any such
thing the matter with her. She had it real
easy, sitting on the floor playing with the
babies. And we never let her carry them up
and down stairs or put anything hard on her,
and now you know they run all over and are
very little trouble. They have always been
such good babies, but if she is going to faint
at every little thing she won&#8217;t be much good.
Mr. Borden has gone for that other girl and
to attend to the necessary business. There
will be the funeral and we shall have to take in
some of the folks, I know. Mrs. Holmes will
stay right along until we are straight again,
but, it&#8217;s asking a good deal I admit,&#8221; and she
paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, let me take her.&#8221; Miss Armitage had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
come primed with several arguments, but she
saw they would not be needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course the shock was awful. Mrs.
Holmes said she wasn&#8217;t surprised, for Marilla
was just going to clasp the outstretched hands,
but the old lady came back to her natural
looks and I&#8217;m so glad; but of course Marilla
will be haunted by the sight&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and you will have so much on your
hands. Do you think she could walk that far
or shall I order a hack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she came down to the nursery and
Bridget brought her up some breakfast.
There&#8217;s the undertaker&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go up to the nursery,&#8221; said Miss Armitage.</p>
<p>A very wan little girl was pillowed upon the
lounge. Jack had been sent to school without
hearing of the happening. Violet was marching
up and down ringing a little bell and saying
&#8220;Go to door, Illa, go to door.&#8221; Pansy was
leaning over her with a book crying authoritatively&mdash;&#8220;Read
to me, read to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage lifted Pansy down but she
started to climb up again. The lady sat down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
in the place and drew Marilla&#8217;s head to her
bosom and let the child cry there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illa can&#8217;t read to you now,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Poor Illa&#8217;s sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t your Illa,&#8221; said the child obstinately.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; Miss Armitage began soothingly,
kissing the tremulous lips, &#8220;you are going
home with me. It has been dreadful I know,
but you must try to forget it. Jane will be
glad to have you and Dr. Richards will comfort
you. Don&#8217;t you remember what a nice
time we had last summer? There dear&mdash;little
Cinderella.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marina smiled faintly through her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so glad. It was so sudden you
know, and when she stretched out her hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must have known you, and after all it
was sweet to be remembered then. Are you
very weak? But I&#8217;m afraid you couldn&#8217;t
walk to Loraine place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so&mdash;so shaky&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Florence entered the room and snatched
the bell from Violet. &#8220;You must not make
such a noise,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Oh Miss Armitage,
you are always shocked by a death,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
aren&#8217;t you? And poor Aunt Hetty has been
dying the last week, though the doctor said
she did not really suffer. But she&#8217;s past
eighty and that&#8217;s a good long life. I do wonder
if she really knew she was calling for Marilla,
and the poor child has had a bad time.
How good of you to offer to take her for awhile.
Funerals are so dismal to a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I had better have a cab,&#8221; said the
guest. &#8220;Will you kindly telephone for one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Borden assented. Then she brought
a frock for Marilla, and between them they
had her dressed. Violet tumbled her box of
blocks on the floor and began kicking them
around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! When you want quiet, children
are always the worst! When that new girl
comes she shall take them out in their carriage
and we will have peace for a little while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Borden entered at that moment with
a very pleasant-faced young woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come through in my room,&#8221; said Miss
Borden, &#8220;and you can watch for the cab.&#8221;
She shut the door between, but the babies
burst into a howl and she went back to pacify
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do feel better,&#8221; exclaimed Marilla,
and her eyes lightened up, &#8220;but no one seems
to know just what to do to amuse the babies,
I&#8217;ve grown so used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They must get along without you for
awhile. It is a pity they couldn&#8217;t be sent
away as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cab came presently. Mr. Borden almost
carried Marilla down stairs. &#8220;Now get
good and rested,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will be a sad
time. Death always is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, how delightful the beautiful house was!
They went through to the library where the
grate fire had been kindled and Marilla drew a
long, happy breath. Why she felt almost
well. Jane brought her some hot milk and
presently spread a dainty little luncheon on
the library table. They had quite a cheerful
time and it seemed as if she improved every
moment.</p>
<p>Dr. Richards thought he would never get
through with the office patients this afternoon
and he was impatient to know what had happened.
As for his own experiences they must
be kept to himself for some time. Indeed he
almost felt as if it was a dream. He had seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
Marilla only three times since her return.
First she had gone to the office to report to
him and let him see what the seaside had done
for her, then the episode of measles had kept
her indoors as well as the babies. He had
met her twice with her precious freight, and
even on Sundays she had not found time to go
to Miss Armitage.</p>
<p>She told the story over to save the child&#8217;s
nerves. &#8220;And so the poor old lady has gone.
Yet I think it hardly fair for you to have to
wait upon her so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh then Mrs. Holmes came and she was
very nice. But as soon as I came in with the
babies she went out for her walk and Aunt
Hetty wanted me to read to her. She liked so
to have me read, and somehow she seemed
gentler and quite sweet like after she was so
poorly. I liked it better than being so much
with the children. They were growing so big
and strong and wanted to keep tumbling over
me. It made me so tired sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla is never going back there,&#8221; Dr.
Richards said decisively. &#8220;She isn&#8217;t strong
enough for a nurse girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she is not going back. I went out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
awhile ago to see that Mrs. Johnson, but she
thought the place an excellent one, and that
it was a bad thing to change girls about, making
them dissatisfied everywhere, but I meant
to bide my time, and find an opportunity.
Now I think they will be willing to give her
up as they have a grown-up woman. She
came while I was there. Dr. Baker told
them Marilla had a weak heart, and I
think it startled them. They have no idea
how hard she has been worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, he longed to tell her of Marilla&#8217;s good
fortune. Somehow they must manage to
share the child between them. She had the
lovely home and the mother heart, and he
wanted a home with a sweet little girl in it.</p>
<p>At Arch street there was a good deal of
confusion. Cousins and nieces who had called
only at rare intervals on Mrs. Vanderveer were
most attentive, suddenly. They did wonder
between themselves if Aunt Hetty was going
to leave <i>all</i> her money to John Borden!</p>
<p>The new nurse, Lizzie by name, was really
a great comfort. She took up the babies in
the morning, bathed and dressed them and
gave them their breakfast. They still took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
their midday nap but she managed to introduce
some discipline, yet she was not harsh.
Master Jack stood a little in awe of her. She
was a good seamstress also.</p>
<p>So passed the three days and they brought
Aunt Hetty down in the parlor and put her
in a fine casket, keeping the doors shut until
the hour for service. Mrs. Seymour had the
nurse bring the children in her house. So
they said prayers reverently, sang some lovely
parting hymns and laid her away, her long
life on earth finished.</p>
<p>The relatives were asked to meet at Mr.
Borden&#8217;s office the next day at ten to hear the
will read.</p>
<p>Was ever any will satisfactory where property
was divided up into small gifts? Five
hundred dollars to this one and to that one,
three hundred apiece to some others. Jack,
Jr., had five hundred, the babies, three hundred,
and Marilla Bond, three hundred.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very nice of her in a way,&#8221; said Mrs.
Borden, &#8220;but I think one hundred dollars
would have been remembrance enough for the
little waiting on she did, and I find Lizzie is of
much more service than she was. Of course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
she costs more. I shall go out to the Home
some day and give her up on account of her
health. Miss Armitage might as well take
her. She&#8217;ll make a nice little waitress maid.
And now that the house is clear I feel that we
needn&#8217;t economize so closely. You and John
get your five hundred with the rest, and she
gave me her diamond ear rings after we came
back in the summer. It was smart in her not
to have John make her will, so none of them
can say he persuaded her. Well, now we can
settle ourselves to the next thing.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A WONDERFUL HAPPENING</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Borden was surprised that Mrs. Johnson
received back Marilla Bond&#8217;s indentures
with no remonstrance or objection. She certainly
had not known about this weak heart.
The child had never been ill, but something
else might come to hand. She was glad there
was no other reason and that the little girl had
proved trustworthy.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage was also surprised that Mrs.
Johnson would not agree to an immediate
transferrence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go on keeping her for awhile,&#8221;
said the lady in a lofty manner. &#8220;<i>You</i> may
tire of her. We will see presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all the permission she could get
and it was a blow to Miss Armitage. She had
come to love the child with a fervor she had
hardly dreamed of and Marilla simply adored
her. Dr. Richards teased her a little about
her fortune. She was quite a welcome guest
at the Bordens and the twins almost devoured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
her when she came, but poor Bridget was
nearly heart broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had a little girl of my own I could hardly
love her any better, and Marilla Bond, if I
was a rich woman I&#8217;d steal you some day and
we&#8217;d go off to some place in Europe, Paris,
maybe, and have a beautiful house and servants
to wait on us and horses and a carriage
and we&#8217;d travel about like grand folks. It
would be as nice as that night when you went
to the palace and danced with the Prince, and
I&#8217;d buy you fine clothes and diamonds and I&#8217;d
wait on you hand and foot; I don&#8217;t wonder the
babies loved you. You are the sweetest thing
the good God ever sent down here!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Marilla hugged Bridget and kissed
her and they both cried out of pure love.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Lizzie does very well and don&#8217;t
bother me, but it isn&#8217;t like having some one to
slip up to you with a smile of sunshine that
warms your heart through and through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet it was flattering to be so well loved, but
she did not want to come back and be a nurse
maid again. Ah, if she could only stay with
Miss Armitage! She began to study a little,
she was so eager to learn. The music enchanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
her and she was delighted to pick out
tunes with her soft touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what Mrs. Johnson
means,&#8221; Miss Armitage said to the doctor.
&#8220;I offered to adopt Marilla and educate her
and see that she was well placed in life. I
have no near relatives, and I don&#8217;t believe I
shall ever marry, I like my life as it is, but she
was so sort of mysterious and secretive and
declared she could not give an answer at present,
as if she had some further plans. I did
make the most of her having a weak heart&mdash;you
said so and Doctor Baker as well. Oh, do
you believe there is any real danger?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned pale at the thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;With care I think she will outgrow it. She
has lived in an overstrained atmosphere with
those children. Then it was a dreadful shock
to have the old lady die that way when she was
looking for a tender recognition. What happened
about a fortnight before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, I found her unconscious.
The ladies were out, the old Aunt had a stroke.
It is such a sweet, promising life, and can be
developed into something worth while. You
may think me visionary&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>Oh, why could she not see this other life
that might be blessed and broadened by her
love!</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid there is something back of it all
that I cannot fathom,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;It
haunts me. Suppose you were to see this
Mrs. Johnson. A man can sometimes penetrate
plans&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>And he was in collusion with Mrs. Johnson,
keeping the secret from the woman he loved,
but if there should be some mistake!</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will see Mrs. Johnson,&#8221; he said
slowly.</p>
<p>A light footfall came down the stairs, and
Marilla flew to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought I heard your voice,&#8221; and
both small hands clasped his. &#8220;Fairy godmother
I have spelled all those queer words
until I can just feel them in my brain. Oh,
doctor, when I wrote you that letter last summer
wasn&#8217;t some words wrongly spelled?
You see I <i>had</i> forgotten some things, and I am
learning so much. I want to stay here, and
I don&#8217;t believe any one else wants me&mdash;only
the babies might.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she glanced up at times it seemed as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
if the pupil that was so much darker than the
iris that it flooded it with the tint of the under
wave that seemed to overflow the crest of the
swell. They were unusual eyes, changing with
every emotion. She looked quite well again,
and the lips were rosy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t?&#8221; with a queer little smile.
&#8220;Well the babies can&#8217;t have you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bridget thinks if she were rich she
would run away with me,&#8221; and she laughingly
detailed the woman&#8217;s plan for their journeying
about.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Bridget should get a windfall&mdash;servants
do sometimes, we should have to keep a sharp
eye on you both, and now I must go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t he stay to dinner?&#8221; She crossed
over and pressed Miss Armitage&#8217;s hand to her
soft cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why we shall be glad to have him, but you
must notify Jane and Norah.&#8221;</p>
<p>She returned with the compliments of both.
While they were waiting for the summons and
being beguiled with her pleasant chatter he
was thinking what a charming family group
they would make. If he only had the old
fortune!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>They had an enjoyable time and when they
returned to the library she begged him to play
chess. She was so fond of following the
devious course of the opposing parties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Office calls will not begin until eight,&#8221; he
said and she rolled up the table and brought
out the beautiful chess men. She was always
so deft it was a pleasure to watch her.</p>
<p>He was playing for the white queen; he
often did. This time he studied his moves
cautiously. But Miss Armitage had played
so much with her uncle. Then the telephone
rang and he went astray.</p>
<p>She answered it. &#8220;For Dr. Richards, a Mr.
Lorimer was in the office, wanted to see him
at once. Important; everything was progressing
finely. Could he not see the little
heiress that evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at Miss Armitage in ludicrous
dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sin finds you out, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; with
an amused yet deprecating smile. &#8220;I suppose
I ought to have explained before, but really
I could hardly believe it would amount to
anything. Marilla must have come from fairy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
land to have all these things happen to her.
May I ask Mr. Lorimer here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. You are very mysterious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Richards went on with the telephone
talk, giving explicit directions how to find
Loraine place where they were all assembled,
and, all anxious to hear his story. Then he
took both little soft hands in his.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you say if a real fortune was
coming to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why there&#8217;s Aunt Hetty&#8217;s money and that
will double in fourteen years, Mr. Borden
said, but I like fairy godmother better than
any fortune. Come, and go on with the
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I must explain to Miss Armitage.
This was why Mrs. Johnson acted rather
queer. She was enjoined to silence. And
the funny thing was she didn&#8217;t half believe
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down and placed his arm around
Marilla, drawing her nearer. Miss Armitage
had a little jealous pang.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the side of Marilla&#8217;s mother an old man
died recently who was nearly a hundred. He
had a sort of farm and an old house and lived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
like a hermit with pigs and ducks and chickens.
He had six children, but they married and
went off. This is the fourth generation.
There was no will so they had to find all the
heirs in order to get a good deed to the property.
They traced Mrs. Bond and learned
she has left a child. They found the woman
who had kept her, but on her re-marriage she
had placed the child at Bethany Home, Newton.
So Mr. Lorimer, an old chum of mine
came to this place, as he is a member of the
firm settling the estate. We went out to the
Home&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long ago?&#8221; asked Miss Armitage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, something over a fortnight. We
had a rather difficult time to persuade Mrs.
Johnson to give up the important papers.
She is very matter of fact and I suppose has
heard many a wild story that came to nothing.
You see she always keeps whatever comes with
a child until the girl is eighteen, when they
are given to her. We found old Doctor
Langdon who could substantiate everything
and who gave an affidavit, so they were to
proceed at once to a settlement. The city
has taken a strip for an avenue extension, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
they want a good deed. I heard from Lorimer
a few days ago, and he said that everything
was right, that he should be at Newton shortly
and wanted to see Marilla Bond.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how much may this wonderful fortune
be?&#8221; The lady&#8217;s tone was slightly sarcastic.
&#8220;They are apt to shrink by payment
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere about ten thousand, I believe.
Not enough to make one a millionaire, but it
will educate her and give her some journeys
outside of fairy land,&#8221; laughing a little. &#8220;Perhaps
fairy godmother won&#8217;t send you adrift
for such an accident,&#8221; looking down in the
wondering eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best fortune of all is fairy godmother.&#8221;
Marilla went around and kissed
her, clasped both her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I heard from Lorimer that it was all
fair sailing I went out and called on Mrs.
Johnson. Well, you should have seen her!
She was quite set up on a pinnacle and declared
that she must write out the story. It
is as well I suppose that Newton should have
it first hand, and she will take most of the
glory. The Bordens will be surprised.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>There was a touch of awkwardness in the
silence. Miss Armitage did not take kindly
to the fortune. She would rather have the
child owe everything to her. She had plenty
of money. It would be like a young sister
growing up beside her, for somehow she felt
curiously young. Marilla had a simple charming
grace that would render her very attractive.
Her perfect candor and honesty joined
with a peculiar fine reticence unusual in a
child had appealed strongly to Miss Armitage.
Even her gratitude had a winsome delicacy in
it, and it would be a gracious work to train her
in lovely womanly ways through the years to
come.</p>
<p>Did the child feel the subtle atmosphere?</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairy godmother, you will always be the
best thing in my life,&#8221; she said in a soft, sweet
tone. &#8220;In the summer when I was wondering
in that strange country and could not remember
much, I felt a sweet quiet when you came,
just as if some one found me and I was safe.
Oh, I had never loved any one so dearly. I
saw so little of my own mother and she was
always tired, fairy godmothers are different.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door bell rang. &#8220;That must be Lorimer,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
said Dr. Richards and he reached the
hall just as Jane opened the door. Miss
Armitage let him greet his friend before she
rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I bring him in here?&#8221; asked the
doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This room is my ideal, Lorimer. The
grate fire and the shelves of books give one an
immediate welcome. And allow me to present
you to the presiding genius, Miss
Armitage.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was indeed a charming home with an
atmosphere that penetrated one&#8217;s soul, and
they two looked as if they might have been
born in it, they impressed you as being a
subtle part of it. It was like a vision as Lorimer
was seating himself, and his eyes caught
the situation of the chess men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one made a false move,&#8221; he exclaimed,
laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the white queen in danger? I can&#8217;t
have her taken,&#8221; Marilla said breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, are you on her side? If I had time
I&#8217;d rescue her. I suppose my friend here, the
doctor, has explained my errand&mdash;the rest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
is&mdash;you are the little white queen and I am an
ogre come to capture you and take you away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going,&#8221; returned the child.
&#8220;When one has a fairy godmother one is
enchanted and the evil ogre is powerless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is it that way? Then I must sue
humbly to the power above and present my
case, for indeed, if you didn&#8217;t want your fortune
you would stop the wheels of division and
perhaps be accused of contempt of court&mdash;which
you don&#8217;t know a word about. You are
quite a little heroine with your romantic
story, and I am charged to bring you into
court and prove you are Marilla Bond, entitled
to a slice of this pie they are going to serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there four and twenty black birds in
it?&#8221; she asked mirthfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, more than that, but there is no flaw in
your claim, and I have unearthed a delightful
relative for you, a cousin of your mother&#8217;s
with whom much of her early life was passed.
After her marriage they seemed to fall apart
as people often do, and she heard you were all
dead. She has three charming girls, fourteen,
eleven and seven. Mrs. Warren made me
promise to bring you direct to her; she is very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
anxious to see you and will take good care of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Armitage had a stunned sort of feeling.
There were relatives who might have a right
to her. She was no longer a waif for some
one&#8217;s charity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will bring her back?&#8221; she said hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course. They are not likely to make
her a ward in chancery as if she had a million.
Dr. Richards will be her guardian, you will
like that, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; smiling at her bright-eyed
watchfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know what a guardian is,&#8221;
doubtfully, glancing at her oldest friend,
&#8220;Mr. Borden never spoke of one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That estate has not been settled yet,&#8221; remarked
the doctor. &#8220;A trustee might answer
for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A guardian is a person appointed to see
that you have a good home, and do not waste
your money, but I have heard of guardians
who wasted it for you. We shall have the
doctor bound securely, and you must have an
allowance for clothes and various needs, such
as ice cream and candy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>Marilla laughed then. It seemed amusing
and very delightful that the doctor should have
some real right to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have never been to New York?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; with a wonder in her tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it will be a great treat. Can she be
ready by tomorrow morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will she be really needed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, tomorrow is set for the finishing of
her business; I must get back early. There is
a big fight on another estate. What an
amount of litigation money does make! This
has been clear sailing after we found all the
heirs and fenced out all those who had no
claim. Miss Marilla Bond, I congratulate
you, and I should really like to hear Mrs.
Johnson on the subject. Were you happy
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I liked it better at Mrs. Borden&#8217;s, but it is
best here,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>They branched off into several amusing
episodes. Miss Armitage ordered some coffee
and cake. Lorimer glanced at the chess men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why were you on the side of the white
queen?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because I chose her for Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
Armitage, and nothing must happen to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh! There was an earnest of love in the
beautiful eyes. She was a charming little
girl.</p>
<p>Then they made all arrangements; they
were to take the 8:10 train. &#8220;Could Marilla
be ready that early in the morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the rather reluctant answer.</p>
<p>They made their adieu. Lorimer thanked
her for a delightful evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s all settled, old fellow! You
are lucky with the prospect of such a home and
such a presiding&mdash;shall I call her the goddess
of the hearth? That room is a perfect gem,
and you three people are to the manner born.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast if you please. It is outside of
my daily life, a place of rest and refreshing
where a pilgrim may pause now and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You two people are in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, I admit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are a dolt if you don&#8217;t go in and
win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her more than a year ago. She
gave me friendship. We are simply good
comrades in our work for the world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t look like a woman whose heart
is buried in some one&#8217;s grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a foolish, insurmountable reason.
I am a few years her junior,&#8221; he said in a half
satiric tone. &#8220;And I have a reason that escaped
me then. She is rich and I am comparatively
poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! There should never be anything
but pure love between the man and the
woman who are the complement of each other.
What a fascinating picture you three made!
And you both love the child. I&#8217;m glad she
is going to have a chance with education.
With those eyes she ought to be beyond the
ordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she will be in good hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Al&mdash;you are an idiot. Some day you will
rue this shilly-shallying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Richards&#8217; reply was an unmirthful
laugh, as if he was not rueing the mischance
all the time. But he was proud and would
not go back of his word.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A NEW ATMOSPHERE</h3>
</div>
<p>They came back to the sleepy grate fire.
Miss Armitage said&mdash;&#8220;You must go to bed
for you will have to be up early in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall only stay a little while,&#8221; as if she
had been musing over her journey. &#8220;Fairy
godmother why don&#8217;t you come, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see I was not asked, I am outside
of all this business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was on the verge of a touch of
bitterness, though nature and endeavor had
made it sweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s funny. They did not know
how much I should want you. I&#8217;ll ask the
doctor in the morning. Oh, I wonder if I
shall like those little cousins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear, you must not speak of it. There
is nothing for me to do. Sometime we will
go to the city together and have a nice outing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you glad the doctor is going to be my
guardian, and&mdash;about the fortune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have a better one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t women be guardians? But I&#8217;d
rather have you for a fairy godmother. No
one else in the whole wide world could be that,
you know. For the one in the dream wasn&#8217;t
truly alive. I don&#8217;t believe she could have
taken care of a sick body. Oh you are so
sweet! I love you! love you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Would the child always love her? She was
coming to the crucial years. She was very
fond and sincere now, but she had cause to be
grateful. She knew so little of the world, she
had a winsome charm that was unfolding every
day, she would be attractive to others. Jane
was her fervent admirer, Bridget adored her,
the babies capered around when they saw her
in a species of Indian dance.</p>
<p>Yes, she would win love, she would not be
dependent on her alone. Would there come
a time when she would flit from the wing of
fairy godmother and find her only an ordinary
friend?</p>
<p>There seemed a sudden dreariness in the
world like a bright day clouding over. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
ought not look so to a woman of five and
thirty with health and prosperity and plenty
of work that did interest her. Other orphan
girls might appeal to her to make their lonely
lives blossom with hope and happiness.</p>
<p>Yes, she must let her go with earnest
wishes for her future. She would rejoice in
whatever came to her and not ask all the
fragrance of the sweet young soul. So she
kissed Marilla a tender good-night.</p>
<p>There were tears in the child&#8217;s eyes when she
started on her journey. Mr. Lorimer met
them at the station with a beautiful box of
chocolates, and there was a pile of illustrated
papers. She had so little idea of money that
even now it was not to be weighed in the balance
with fairy godmother.</p>
<p>They passed through pretty towns but
autumn had stripped the gardens of their
beauty. Even the clumps of evergreens on
the lawns looked lonesome. She had never
gone through a gloomy tunnel before and was
a little frightened. Emerging from it the
great city filled her with wonder.</p>
<p>Then they took a hack. Oh, how full of
everything the streets were, pedestrians dodging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
this way and that, vehicles in a snarl and
trolleys whizzing by. It was a miracle people
did not get run over.</p>
<p>They reached their destination and Lorimer
ushered them in a sort of ante room, taking
her to a lady who rose to greet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so this is cousin Marion&#8217;s little girl
who has been motherless for years! We heard
you were dead. If I had known you were
living I should have come for you. We were
very dear to each other but on her marriage
she went away. I can&#8217;t see that you resemble
her much except that she was fair and had
light curly hair, and how she did hate it!&#8221;
laughed Mrs. Warren.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it,&#8221; rejoined Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she used to soap it and brush it and
would never let it really curl; but it was a bed
of waves. Oh, child! I&#8217;m glad to see you. I
was very fond of your mother, and though
our fortunes are not very large I suppose we
can be thankful for them. It was a great
surprise to me. You&#8217;re hardly old enough to
realize all its benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lorimer went to see when their turn would
come. Mrs. Warren and the doctor talked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
about Marilla. Then they were summoned
to a crowded room where men were signing
papers and there was such a hum of talking
it was like a swarm of bees.</p>
<p>Marilla held tightly to Mrs. Warren&#8217;s hand.
Dr. Richards was answering questions and a
man seemed to verify them from books and
papers. They had a corner to themselves.
Then Marilla was questioned about the Home
and her being bound-out and she had to declare
she was the same little girl, that her
mother and father were dead, that she had
always lived at Newton.</p>
<p>Then some papers were signed and she was
taken in a small room which was filled with
tall cases and a great business desk where sat
a sharp-eyed man. He wheeled around so
suddenly that she started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is Dr.
Richards a relative? Do you live with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but he had been so good to her when
Miss Armitage had taken her in so she need
not go to the hospital. She had been bound-out
but the family could not take care of her.
Some one had just died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would she like Dr. Richards for her guardian?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
Had any one told her she must have
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I want him, I love him,&#8221; and the
flood of eager joy in her sweet face answered
him as truly as the words.</p>
<p>He was curiously interested and drew her
out a little further, charmed with her simplicity.</p>
<p>Then Doctor Richards had to sign the bond
and they were dismissed. Mrs. Warren would
take her home, and her guardian would come
in the afternoon and take dinner with them
and meet Mr. Warren.</p>
<p>There were two trolley rides, then a walk
from the corner. The house was in a brick
row up on the East side with a little park opposite,
and the river only a block away.</p>
<p>The basement windows had tall iron bars
that suggested a prison to the child. They
ascended the high stoop and the hall door was
flung open while a chorus of eager voices
cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is this the new cousin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Marilla Bond. This is Edith, this
is May and this is our baby Jessie&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We were afraid you wouldn&#8217;t get here in
time. We had begun our lunch&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run back dears, we will be down in a
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>They kissed Marilla with sweet heartiness
that won her at once. Mrs. Warren took off
her wrap and hat and they went down. How
strange it was to have these girls smiling and
expressing delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to keep her, mother?&#8221; declared
Edith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, as long as her guardian will let her
stay. You will find her here when you come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And wasn&#8217;t it funny to have a fortune
drop down on you? Mother could hardly
believe it at first, and then we were so glad to
find you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilla glanced up with a smile, but she
wanted to cry for very joy.</p>
<p>Then they kissed her again and ran off to
school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were there any children where you lived?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at Miss Armitage&#8217;s. That was where
I was ill. She took me in, but I had to go back
to Mrs. Borden&#8217;s when I was strong enough.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
And then an old lady died and I fainted again
and the doctor said it was something with the
heart, and they had to take a bigger girl.
Then I went to Miss Armitage again. She is
so dear and sweet. I want to stay there always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor child! You see we were in
Western New York when your mother died
and we didn&#8217;t hear of it in a long while. We
should not have let you go to that Home.
Were they good to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see some of the children were
not very good, and they only gave you so
much to eat. Sometimes you felt real hungry.
I tried to be good for I didn&#8217;t like to be
punished,&#8221; she said naively. &#8220;You had to
scrub floors and learn psalms, when you didn&#8217;t
get whipped. I liked the hymns, only they
were not always sweet and pretty, and we
went in school at nine and had one little recess.
Then after dinner, and school until four, and
if you missed you had to stay in. You sewed
half an hour then and could play out of doors
until six, then you had supper and went to
bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of sewing was it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you hemmed towels and sheets and
pillow cases, and mended. The little girls
couldn&#8217;t, so you had to look after their things,
and darn their stockings. On Saturday afternoon
one of the teachers took you out walking
but it was in the woods and the country. All
the girls were <i>so</i> glad when they were twelve
or almost, so they could get away. Mrs.
Johnson was very sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the lady you went to live with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh she was very nice; and her sister. There
was a boy of five and twin babies&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have to take care of the
babies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to play with them and amuse them.
They were very fat and Mrs. Borden didn&#8217;t
like me to lift them. Then I used to wheel
them in their carriage. I liked that only when
it was very cold&mdash;or hot. The stores were so
pretty, and you met other girls. I used to
read the books in the windows; Jack had lots
of books. I used to show the pictures to the
babies and tell them stories and they would
laugh so, just as if they understood it all.
They were very good and merry, but it was a
long while before they could walk, they were
so fat.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How did she come to let you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one very hot day&mdash;and somehow I
was so dreadfully tired all the time, I sat down
on a stoop&mdash;it was a beautiful, shady street
with great trees, and most everybody had gone
away. The babies were not very well and a
little cross. You had to be doing things all
the while, and&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what happened,
but I fell off the stoop and some one picked
me up and then Miss Armitage who lived opposite
came over and had me taken to her
house and for a long while I just seemed in
the dark and didn&#8217;t know anything. It was
then that Dr. Richards came. They were all
so good, and it was like being in heaven. The
Bordens had gone to Long Island and the
babies were very sick getting some teeth, and
they wanted me, I was bound, you know, so
I had to go as soon as I was well enough.
Part of it was very nice; the babies could walk
then. After we came back&#8221;&mdash;she made a
little pause for she had not even told Dr.
Richards Jack&#8217;s part in the mishap&mdash;&#8220;I fainted
one day. Their old aunt was ill and she wanted
me, so I went and&mdash;it was dreadful&mdash;she
died and I fainted again. Then Miss Armitage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
came and took me home with her. Mrs.
Borden took a new nursemaid, a grown up
woman and was willing to let me go, and these
other things happened. Oh, I want to stay
always with Miss Armitage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor little girl! I think you have had
a rather hard time. What does Dr. Richards
say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The other doctor said I had a weak heart.
Does that make you faint away? It&#8217;s almost
like dying&mdash;you don&#8217;t seem to know anything
for a long while, and it is very hard to get
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been worked pretty hard I
guess.&#8221; How simply the child had told her
story. &#8220;But now life will be better. I am
very glad this little fortune has come to you,
and now I am going up stairs a few moments,
and you may look over the books on the table.
I will soon be back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead Marilla looked about the room.
The front one was the parlor, very nicely furnished.
The back one shut off the end of the
hall. There were three French windows reaching
to the floor, the last one being a door leading
out to an enclosed porch with windows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
that would be very pleasant in summer.
There was only a small yard with a tiny grass
plot and an alleyway running through at the
back.</p>
<p>There was a big book case in one recess, a
lounge, a Morris chair and a substantial
center table containing books and papers.
It had a home-like, well used look, with several
cosy rocking chairs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Warren returned with some sewing and
without evincing undue curiosity led Marilla
to talk of her past, though the child really
knew very little about her mother and seemed
to have no tender or regretful regard for this
Mrs. Jaques. But her whole heart went out
to Miss Armitage in something like worship.</p>
<p>The girls came home and in a short time
they were all friends. It seemed odd to them
that Marilla had never been to a real school.
Jessie was in the kindergarten, but would
enter the primary in February. May was
there and Edith hoped to get in the High
School another year. Then they carried her
off to their play room. This was the hall bedroom
on the next floor. There was a small
book case, a sort of closet with glass doors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
where playthings were kept and one shelf
devoted to dolls. Marilla stood entranced
before it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you many dolls?&#8221; asked May.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had a doll since my mama died,&#8221;
and there were tears in the child&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;But at Christmas&mdash;didn&#8217;t you ever get a
doll?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in a home for orphan girls, Mrs.
Johnson didn&#8217;t think it was right for girls
to waste their time on dolls. One Christmas
some store sent such a beautiful lot and she
returned them all. Some of us cried and we
had to learn a lot of bible verses about improving
your time. Occasionally a girl would
get a clothes pin and tie the middle of her
handkerchief around the head, and play it
was a baby, and lend it out, then they would
all get punished. I used to feel so sorry.
Dolls are so sweet if they are only make believe.
Where I lived the babies had rubber
dolls that they could bang on the floor, but
they were ugly. This one is splendid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is mine,&#8221; said Edith. &#8220;One of our
cousins brought it from Paris. It can walk a
little and say &#8216;Mama.&#8217; I&#8217;m too big to play
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
with dolls, and I&#8217;ve given the others to May
and Jessie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we play tea with them. It is so
lovely out on the back porch in the summer and
mother lets us take the things down there.
And I can make clothes,&#8221; said May. &#8220;But
now you can have a doll, because you are
going to have some money of your very own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she returned slowly.</p>
<p>There were many pretty things that Marilla
wondered at. Edith took out her doll and
put it in the visitor&#8217;s arms. It had such a
lovely face that Marilla hugged it up tight and
wanted to kiss it. Why it was fifty times
sweeter than the twins.</p>
<p>Then they led her to their room. There
were two pretty brass beds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Edith has the smaller one because she
sleeps alone,&#8221; explained May, &#8220;and we little
ones love to sleep together.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were two chiffoniers, and a big closet
between the rooms, two pretty willow rockers
and some lovely pictures beside various small
gifts one could hang up or stand around.
How charming it was!</p>
<p>Edith said she must go and study her lessons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
May brought out her pretty dishes and
her card albums. One was partly full of such
pretty kittens Marilla wanted to hug them.
Another was Christmas, Easter and birthday
cards.</p>
<p>Marilla gave a soft little sigh. How many
precious things she had missed out of her life!
And though she could not have put it into
words it was the tender companionship of
childhood, of kindred tastes and eager loves.
In the desert of Bethany Home all these
emotions had been rigorously repressed. It
was best for girls not to expect too much in the
homes of other people, the little Cinderella
whose place was in the chimney corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla,&#8221; called the voice of Mrs. Warren,
in a sort of joyous tone, &#8220;Dr. Richards has
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>She almost flew down stairs and he clasped
her in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so happy,&#8221; she cried in a voice tremulous
with emotion. &#8220;It seems such a long,
long while since morning so much has happened,
and Mrs. Warren is to be my Aunt
Grace, she said so, and I have three cousins!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was alight with happiness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you would get homesick if we
did not go back to Newton until some time
next week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. I shouldn&#8217;t get homesick at all!
But I couldn&#8217;t stay away from fairy godmother
a <i>long</i> while. If I didn&#8217;t have her, Aunt
Grace would take me, and the girls are just
splendid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to a hospital this afternoon and
I want to learn some new things to take home
with me, so I will write. You must write, too.
I&#8217;ve brought you some envelopes addressed and
stamped. Why do you smile?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of the letter I wrote to you
in the summer, and I had to beg everything to
write with, and Edith has such a nice portable
writing desk, and the girls have portfolios,
and they all go to school. Oh, it must be
splendid to go to school with a crowd of nice
girls and have a lovely teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had been leading him through the parlor.
Mrs. Warren met them and he went
on in the sitting room, apologizing for his
early appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I want you to come in and see your
ward whenever you can, and I shall beg for
quite a visit from her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That will suit me. I feel that I have
grown a little rusty and want to look into some
new methods. What a wonderful city it is!
It quite shames a country doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; smiling. &#8220;You should come
in often. Mr. Warren will be home presently
and glad to meet you. Will you excuse me a
few moments? This is my eldest daughter,
Edith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And can&#8217;t the others come?&#8221; asked Marilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Richards was used to children. He
thought he liked girls the best, and this was
an attractive circle. How Marilla was enjoying
it. Her eyes quivered with flashes of
pleasure. Yes, children needed other children
to start the real flow of delight through
their veins, and his little Cinderella did not
suffer by comparison.</p>
<p>Mr. Warren came in and welcomed his
guest cordially, looking over the little girl
about whom they had speculated. She was
very attractive just now, with her face of
sunshine and her eyes with their starry look
under the long curling lashes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>The men had to discuss the queer unexpected
fortune. The Warrens had been notified
nearly a year before.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I hadn&#8217;t much faith in it,&#8221; laughed
Mr. Warren. &#8220;My wife had really forgotten
her family lineage, and we should hardly have
claimed the Schermerhorns. There&#8217;s so much
red tape in these matters and by the time the
expenses are paid, there&#8217;s little left for the
heirs, but this turns out better than I supposed,
considering the many descendants the old
man had. I can&#8217;t complain of the lawyers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we were very glad to find Marion&#8217;s
child, though I wish I had known it when her
mother died. Do you want to keep her at
Newton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Miss Armitage has some claims,&#8221;
he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I feel as if we ought to make up for
our negligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children were in a little huddle on the
corner of the sofa. What was Newton like?
A real city?</p>
<p>&#8220;Why there are some beautiful long streets
and stores and churches and a park and rows
of houses built together like this, and schools
and trolleys&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why it must be a city then?&#8221; said Edith.
&#8220;Has it a mayor and a city hall and a postoffice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has a mayor and a postoffice and a court
house. Mr. Borden used to talk of going
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very old town,&#8221; explained the guardian,
&#8220;dating farther back than the Revolution,
yet it was not much of a business center
until the last thirty years; but it is very pretty
and rather aristocratic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; said their mother, &#8220;go and make
yourselves ready for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What lovely curly hair,&#8221; exclaimed May,
half in envy. &#8220;I wish mine curled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have two such beautiful braids.&#8221;
&#8220;Jessie&#8217;s curled a little but it was so thin
mother kept cutting it. Dear me! You
wouldn&#8217;t catch me soaping and brushing the
curl out of it if mine curled,&#8221; declared May.</p>
<p>They had a rather merry time at dinner and
the children did not seem a bit afraid to talk,
though they were not aggressive. But Dr.
Richards thought his little ward compared
very favorably with the others. Her daintiness
suggested Miss Armitage, he fancied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>They sat a long while over their dessert of
fruit and nuts, and then the guest said he
would have to go as he wanted to attend a
lecture by an eminent surgeon. He would be
in tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I would take Marilla out shopping
with me. Come in to dinner again
and spend the whole evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Richards promised to.</p>
<p>The others went up to the sitting room.
Mr. Warren took possession of the big Morris
chair, May had one knee, Jessie the other and
Edith seated herself on the broad arm and
placed her arm over her father&#8217;s shoulder.
They always exacted an hour of their father
and he gave it with the utmost fondness.</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is a place for you, little Marilla,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Now the chair is full. I&#8217;ve wondered
sometimes if Edith wouldn&#8217;t tip us
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have to be as fat as Auntie Belle to do
that,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;and now papa I want
Marilla to tell you about a queer Home she
was put in where they wouldn&#8217;t let the little
girls have dolls nor playthings, and they
made dollies out of clothes pins and had to
hide them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That was cruel to little girls. Why they
have dolls by right and no one should prevent
them. Didn&#8217;t you play any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, out of doors, tag and Uncle John
and Scotland&#8217;s burning, and Lady Jane, and
Ring around a Rosy; and then in summer you
had to pull weeds in the garden. When it
rained you had to march in doors, but if you
tried to dance a little you had to go and sit
down. Oh, they were very strict.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what else did you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the bigger girls made the beds and
twice a week brushed up the floors, and every
little while you went in the kitchen for a week
and helped with the cooking so you would
know how to work. When you were twelve
they bound you out and you had to stay until
you were eighteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you study any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, there was school every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did <i>you</i> get bound-out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She flushed a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you did not stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, tell papa about the babies,&#8221; cried
Edith.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And did you ever notice the Campbell&#8217;s
soup little girl with her round eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who gets fat on eating soup? Yes,&#8221; and
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They looked something like that,&#8221; said
Marilla. &#8220;They were so fat and they had such
round eyes, and you could make them laugh
so easily. I went to take care of them and
amuse them, but they were so good, they
hardly ever cried, and I used to ride them
round&mdash;they had such a beautiful wagon!
But sometimes it seemed so heavy, it had to
be big, you know, and then there was Jack.
He wasn&#8217;t very good, but after awhile he went
to kindergarten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you get away if you were
bound?&#8221;</p>
<p>She told the story very simply and how a
lovely lady took her in and she was ill a long
while, and she knew this was a fairy godmother,
so she always called her that,
because&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a curious dream I had. Bridget
said it was a dream; but it seemed so real, and
I was Cinderella.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do tell us!&#8221; they pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid it&#8217;s silly,&#8221; and she flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cinderella is lovely, and did you see the
Prince?&#8221;</p>
<p>They all looked so eager that she was persuaded.
So she began by sitting in the corner
of the kitchen and they listened as if they were
enchanted. She was so vivid it seemed as if
her face was transfigured. Mrs. Warren
dropped her sewing and bent forward.</p>
<p>Edith drew a long breath and squeezed the
new cousin&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Oh&#8221; she cried, &#8220;it&#8217;s
lovelier than the real Cinderella, and you
danced with the Prince? Can you dance&mdash;truly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, after that, I used to dance for
Bridget. Mrs. Johnson wouldn&#8217;t let you, she
thought it wicked. It&#8217;s queer how people
think about things, and I danced for the babies.
Mrs. Borden and her sister went to
dancing parties; they didn&#8217;t think it wrong.
It&#8217;s so beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our cousins Isabel and Charlie Firth go to
dancing school. Mother thinks I may go next
winter. They are teaching it in some schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; said Mrs. Warren, &#8220;do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
know what time it is? You must go to bed.
Marilla you have betwitched us all. And
papa will have hardly time to read his paper.
Come. Marilla will not run away, so you can
have her tomorrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Warren kissed all the little girls and
they trooped off.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may sleep on the lounge in my room,
Edith, and give Marilla your bed, I can&#8217;t send
her up stairs alone, and now you must not say
a word after your prayers for I know she is
clear tired out.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were generally very good children to
mind. Their mother left them with a good-night
kiss. Mr. Warren had rolled his chair
nearer the center table and taken up his
paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;that Marilla is an
unusual child. How beautifully she describes
everything, but the sweetest trait about her
is her utter lack of bitterness. Most children
would have been sharp and disparaging
about Mrs. Johnson, but she never uttered a
bitter word. It really was wonderful. I
hope that Dr. Richards will give her a first-class
education, and I&#8217;d like to see that fairy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
godmother. Marilla needs good care, she
isn&#8217;t very strong, but there is happiness in
every pulse of her small body. I wish we could
keep her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning the children had to kiss
her half a dozen times before they went to
school, and make her promise over and over
again that she would not let Dr. Richards
take her home. While Mrs. Warren was doing
up her morning&#8217;s work Marilla wrote her
letter to Miss Armitage, who smiled over the
thrill of delight that ran through it. Aunt
Grace was so sweet and lovely and she couldn&#8217;t
describe the girls for she didn&#8217;t know any
words that were beautiful enough and good
enough to apply to them. Jessie was a real
little beauty with the most wonderful eyes
that were like brown velvet and sunshine, and
she didn&#8217;t know father&#8217;s could be so sweet as
Uncle Warren. Maybe Mr. Borden would
love the twins that way when they grew older.
They might be prettier then. But her dear
fairy godmother lived in her mind all the
time, she wanted her to see and hear everything.
There would be so much to tell her
that she couldn&#8217;t write.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>It was a wonderful day to Marilla. Such
splendid stores and gowns that were fit for
queens. Such beautiful dishes and jewelry,
such stacks of books; and, oh, such dolls holding
out their hands with a pleading look in their
eyes. She could hardly tear herself away.
Was she too big to have a doll?</p>
<p>Then they went into a cozy place and had a
dainty lunch, only it did seem as if Marilla
was too happy to eat. If fairy godmother
were only here!</p>
<p>Afterward they went to the Eden Musee.
You had to ride from place to place; why, it was
full of strange people who never stirred. They
could not be dead! What <i>was</i> the matter
with them? The wonder in her eyes made
Mrs. Warren smile. Some were funny, too;
you wanted to laugh with them. Marilla sat
down in perfect despair as if she had gone to
some strange country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how they can make them just
like folks,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You feel almost sure
they are going to speak to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A very tired little girl it was who came home,
but it was such a pleasant, happy tired she
didn&#8217;t mind. It wasn&#8217;t like dragging the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
heavy babies around. Aunt Grace made her
lie down on the lounge and the girls gathered
round her talking it over. They had been
several times.</p>
<p>Then Dr. Richards came in and they had
such a delightful time. Why the whole
world of pleasure was fairy land when you
come to think of it. &#8220;And there&#8217;s the Hippodrome,&#8221;
said Edith. &#8220;Oh mother don&#8217;t you
believe father could take us on Saturday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And couldn&#8217;t I go, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor asked in such a whimsical tone
that they all laughed. Jessie sidled up to
him, she was well so she need not be afraid of
a doctor. She was very sweet but she wasn&#8217;t
quite Cinderella.</p>
<p>What a fine evening they had! It seemed
as if they must have known each other for
years. Bits of Marilla&#8217;s life came out unconsciously;
the doing for others without
thinking of herself that really did glorify it.
Unwittingly she showed more of it to Dr.
Richards than she had ever before in her gratitude.
Under the children&#8217;s questions some
of the trials came out.</p>
<p>Every morning she wrote to Miss Armitage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
out of her full heart, and the lady understood
how she would thrive in natural companionship.
Almost she felt as if she ought to yield
her to these relatives, but she wanted her. It
was strange how she had left her impress everywhere
yet she was a very modest little girl,
demanding nothing, taking all favors with a
gratitude that was fascinating. Jane rehearsed
so many pretty sayings and missed
her everywhere. Bridget came around to
hear whether the story of the fortune was
absolutely true. The Bordens could hardly
believe it. Mr. John Borden wished they had
not let her go quite so soon. &#8220;She certainly
was a nice child,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They went to the great stores and to Central
Park, and Marilla overflowed with happiness.
Why it was like the fairy dream, and she
wished the girls at the Home could have some
of it, or could find a fairy godmother. There
were so many things to interest the doctor.
How the days did slip away and all the time
Marilla grew sweeter, dearer; but at last he
said they <i>must</i> go home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how can we let you go?&#8221; cried Edith.
&#8220;Why I do believe you came from fairy land
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
yourself; but now you&#8217;ll come and visit us
often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you can come to Newton. Fairy
godmother has such a lovely house, and she
is so sweet. You will like her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, the child ought not be on sufferance
but have the genial freedom of a home of her
very own where she could live over the childhood
she had missed and learn the glad inspiration
of youth.</p>
<p>What did Miss Armitage mean to do for
her? Yes, she wanted her; why there would
be a great loss in life without her, but she no
longer needed charity. She could not do
everything for her; as she had planned. Would
she share a divided interest?</p>
<p>Dr. Richards heart yearned over her, coveted
her. Marilla had crept in and taken possession
of his inmost soul. It was not likely
there would be any other occupant. For he
had never seen any sign of relenting on Miss
Armitage&#8217;s part. They were excellent friends.
Neither overstepped the prescribed bounds,
and he must have something to love and to
cherish.</p>
<p>But he had to tear himself away presently,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
and he carried her with him in his heart, and
the next morning he dropped in and had her
all to himself. Mrs. Warren had gone to the
dressmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Marilla said with a long sigh of delight,
&#8220;how lovely it is to have sisters! and&mdash;and
a father! If I couldn&#8217;t have but one I
think I&#8217;d take the father. Isn&#8217;t Mr. Warren
just splendid and sweet and charming? There&#8217;s
a book of poems at Miss Armitage&#8217;s that has
one such beautiful thing&mdash;&#8216;The Children&#8217;s
Hour.&#8217; And they have it here. The hour
after dinner if there are no visitors belongs to
the children. The smaller ones take possession
of his lap and Edith sits on the arm of the
chair. I sat on the other,&#8221; and she laughed
with such a happy sound. &#8220;And they tell
him everything, what they have read and
studied, and the little troubles and differences
and perplexities, and he listens and explains
and laughs with them when it is funny, and
everything is so nice. I didn&#8217;t suppose fathers
could be so dear and sweet, but I never
knew any real father except Mr. Borden, and
Jack was a torment. He wanted to pound
and bang and wrinkle up things and ask silly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
questions. Maybe the twins will be different,
and perhaps he will love girls the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you would like to have a father?&#8221;
There was a subtle sweetness in his tone.</p>
<p>She drew a long breath, he felt the heart
quiver irregularly, the little heart that would
need careful watching the next few years, that
so far had been worked pretty hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so much!&#8221; There was an exquisite
longing and a sound as of a prayer, &#8220;but you
know I&#8217;d want some one I could love.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was ready to give, not take all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marilla, would I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her head and looked at him out
of longing, pleading eyes that turned joyous
like a sudden glowing sunrise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the wonderful satisfying intonation
would have moved any heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want a little girl,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;I shall never have one of my very own;&#8221;&mdash;it
is the way a man thinks when he knows he
cannot have the woman he would choose for
the mother of his children.</p>
<p>She was silent. He saw the shining tears
beading the curly lashes. She was sorry for
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And if you could be <i>my</i> little girl&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if I might!&#8221; and the longing freighted
her tone. &#8220;If I could be good enough&mdash;if I
could love you enough. Oh, I <i>would</i> try. I
should be so happy. To have a father of one&#8217;s
own!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Children are sometimes adopted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they were at Bethany Home, but
they had to be very pretty, I&#8217;m not&mdash;very.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I love you because you are <i>you</i>, I don&#8217;t
want you changed any way. I want a daughter
to be a companion as I grow older, to read
to me, to confide in me, to come to me in any
trouble, to make a real home, for a man alone
cannot do that, and to love me very, very
dearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always loved you,&#8221; she said simply.
Then after a moment&mdash;&#8220;would I live with
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when I have found a pretty home,
and you will make friends and have them
visit you, and we will take journeys and have
pleasures like the Warrens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! How good you are!&#8221; in a tone of
tremulous joy. There was a little twinge of
conscience in both hearts concerning Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
Armitage. He salved his, thinking if she had
wanted to she might have made some proffer
of adoption. Marilla hardly knew how to
choose between them. If they could both go
and live in Loraine place!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see Lorimer this afternoon. You have
to apply to the legislature, and you will have
your name changed to Richards. Maybe the
judge or some will one question you whether
you are willing to take me for a father, since
you are old enough to choose, and there are
several formalities, but the thing is often done,
and you will be mine, mine,&#8221; pressing her to
his heart in rapture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad.&#8221; Every pulse throbbed
with joy.</p>
<p>He yielded to the subtle satisfaction and
kissed the sweet mouth. Oh, he must get
her strong and well and give her a lovely,
long life! Like a vision he could see her
growing sweeter and dearer every year, making
life blossom with her love.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Warren returned and the girls
came home to lunch, having a merry time
talking over the Hippodrome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly every Saturday papa takes us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
somewhere,&#8221; said May. &#8220;There are some
beautiful plays for children and concerts and
all summer the park is splendid, though you
can always go inside and there is so much to
see; and an automobile ride! Oh, I wish you
were going to live here!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were so many pleasures to give his
little girl. It made his heart beat with joy to
think he was going to have one. Life had
seemed a bit lonely as he glanced down the
years. It would never be lonely now. He
would take such pleasure in making her happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get a pretty home
and we will always be together.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE REAL FAIRYLAND</h3>
</div>
<p>That evening the two cousins on the Warren
side came in, Isabel and Willis Firth. Isabel
was just the age of Edith and Willis, older.
The children gave up their hour cheerfully.
There was so much to talk about, and the
school was going to have an entertainment&mdash;&#8220;The
Dance of All Nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not quite <i>all</i>,&#8221; said Isabel,
&#8220;though the boys are to give an Indian dance
in costume, and the Dutch dance is in clogs,
and oh, you can&#8217;t imagine how funny and
clumpy it sounds, but it is real pretty with the
aprons and the caps, but the Spanish is beautiful
with castanets. You must all come.
Is your friend staying long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think&#8221;&mdash;rather hesitatingly, &#8220;we will go
home next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be too bad, and the dance
is to be two weeks from tomorrow, in the afternoon,
in a hall. It will be splendid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose this is the little cousin who came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
after the fortune,&#8221; said Willis, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it nice to
have a fortune left to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know&#8221;&mdash;hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my! I&#8217;d know quick enough,&#8221; laughed
the boy. &#8220;Isabel wouldn&#8217;t it be fine enough
to have ten or twelve thousand left to us?
I&#8217;d be sure of going to college.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The University ought to be good enough
for city boys,&#8221; said Uncle Warren.</p>
<p>They played authors for a while &#8220;because
they could talk&#8221; Willis said. Then Aunt
Warren played for them to dance. At first
Marilla hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s only three-step&#8221; exclaimed Edith.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you, and if you danced at the
King&#8217;s ball&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>She found she could dance easy enough. It
was quite delightful. Her eyes were bright,
her cheeks like roses.</p>
<p>Then they tried several other pretty dances,
and spiced them with much laughter. Oh, how
gay they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it said something about the
King&#8217;s ball?&#8221; asked Willis. &#8220;Was it a make
believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh it is the prettiest thing!&#8221; replied Edith.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Cousin Marilla sat alone in the
kitchen one night when the maid had gone out
and a fairy godmother came and asked her
if she didn&#8217;t want to go to the ball. Finding
her in the kitchen you see she took her for
Cinderella, and she touched her with her
wand&mdash;now Marilla, go on, I couldn&#8217;t tell it
half as delightfully as you do; you make it so
real.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manila&#8217;s face had been scarlet at first, for
she was almost ashamed of being a little
bound-out girl before these newcomers, but
Edith had started it so beautifully that she
smiled at her audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit on the floor,&#8221; said Willis. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the way they do in Persia, and Aunt Grace
never finds fault with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>They gathered around the little girl. Even
Uncle Warren laid down his paper and joined
the circle. And what an attentive audience!</p>
<p>&#8220;Well that&#8217;s just fine!&#8221; ejaculated Willis.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen just such a Cinderella, and
there wasn&#8217;t any glass slipper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interrupt,&#8221; said his sister.</p>
<p>It was all so vivid and Marilla made such
pretty gestures with her hands and swayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
her head to and fro, that they could fairly see
the palace, and the banquet was superb with
its lights and flowers and beautiful adornments.</p>
<p>&#8220;And couldn&#8217;t they dance but just one
evening with the Prince? That was rather
tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there was so many knights and the
Cinderellas seemed just as happy. No one
was cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was wonderful! Oh, didn&#8217;t
you hate to wake up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I did really wake up, and
every night for awhile I seemed dreaming it
over, and I can shut my eyes and see it so
plainly. When things didn&#8217;t go quite right
it was such a pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a darling!&#8221; cried Isabel. &#8220;I
just wish the kindergarten children could hear
it told that way. If you were a grown-up girl
they&#8217;d pay you for telling stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Grace can&#8217;t you bring her around and
let mother hear that?&#8221; asked Willis. &#8220;My
mother is so fat she hates to go out anywhere,&#8221;
to Marilla. &#8220;She thinks it disgraceful! But
she&#8217;s a sweet mother for all that; and now we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
must go home. Thank you a hundred times
for the story. When I have my party I shall
send for you and dance with you every other
time. You ought to be named Cinderella.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked so bright and happy and promised
to visit them if Dr. Richards did not take
her home too soon.</p>
<p>But the Hippodrome was beyond any
dream. Sometimes she held her breath with
delight until she was fairly tired. Dr. Richards
watched the sweet, changeful face. Yes,
she should be all his&mdash;why he had never
dreamed of anything half as sweet as the joy
of a father.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon he and Mr. Lorimer came
in. The girls had gone to Sunday School.
He laid his plan before the Warrens who were
a good deal surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a man grows older he begins to think of
a home and the joys nothing else offers, and
a doctor really needs the comfort, the satisfaction
nothing else can give. I&#8217;ve never had
a home though I&#8217;ve dreamed of one, but there
must be another person in it. I&#8217;m not of the
hermit sort. I want some one to be merry
with me and to comfort me when the skies are
dark and lowering.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dr. Richards, you should marry,&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Warren, impetuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been so engrossed&mdash;and this sort of
vision has come to my very door as it were,
and I have let it in. For a few years Marilla
will need watchful care from some one who
can understand the weak points. I should get
a nice, motherly woman who would be sweet
and tender to her, companionable as well.
For you see she must go to some one for a
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we would gladly take her in here,&#8221; said
Mrs. Warren. &#8220;She has really won our
hearts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He would do Miss Armitage full justice,
at least he thought it so then. He related her
kindness, her generosity, but she had been
tender and sympathetic to many another
child he remembered, yet he could not quite
still the one cry he had heard from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you most sincerely,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;I am glad she has found some relatives who
have taken her in in this cordial manner. I
want her to remain warm friends with you all.
Of course until I was settled to my liking her
home would be with Miss Armitage and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
could come whenever you would like to have
her. A young girl needs friends of her own
kind, whose interests and hopes are similar.&#8221;</p>
<p>They discussed the matter from more than
one point of view. At first Lorimer had tried
to banter him out of the plan, insisting that the
guardianship would be sufficient. There was
something in his earnest desire that touched
the heart of the man of wide experience. He
wondered why he could not be as persistent
to win the lady! Perhaps she would follow
the child.</p>
<p>She came in radiant and full of joy. It was
such a splendid Sunday School. She could
enjoy it thoroughly with no bothering Jack to
think about.</p>
<p>Lorimer made his adieu but the doctor remained.
They sang in the evening. She
caught any tune so readily, and a little bird of
joy kept time in her heart. She had only to
glance up in the doctor&#8217;s eyes to know there
was a kindred delight in his.</p>
<p>She spent most of the next morning writing
to fairy godmother. There was so much to
say, for everything was so new, so different
from her life hitherto. Oh, she was so glad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
she did not have to go back to that! No one
had been really unkind or severe with her and
she could recall some tenderness at the last
on Aunt Hetty&#8217;s part, but the death always
made her shudder.</p>
<p>These days of affliction had been so sweet, so
engrossing. She had not dared to love Miss
Armitage in this fashion in the beginning.
She loved her deeply, truly, now, and her heart
smote her in spite of the thrill of joy when she
thought of Dr. Richard&#8217;s love, of belonging to
him. Would she leave her for the new love?
She had not the courage to mention it, but
there were so many other things to say.</p>
<p>Every day brought something new. They
went to the wonderful museum. She could
not take in half, but Dr. Richards said no one
could. You came time and again, all your
life, and always found something new. And
there were the Historical Society rooms with
their marvellous collection of birds that enchanted
her.</p>
<p>They spent a delightful evening at the
Firths, though she decided she liked Uncle
Warren the better. The Firth house was very
handsomely appointed, but it did not have so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
much the air of home where you could sit on
the arm of the chair and say all manner of
childish things.</p>
<p>Mrs. Firth was very stout, but she had a
really pretty face and a voice that won you
with a certain caressing mellowness. Both
cheeks had a deep dimple and a crease went
from one to the other that seemed to define
the first chin. She sat in a high backed chair
and Marilla thought she looked like a princess,
and her gown made the child think of the
beautiful dresses in the fairy place.</p>
<p>But on Friday Dr. Richards said they <i>must</i>
go back to Newton. They would come again
however, there was still a little business to
settle. It was a sad parting, and when Marilla
took her seat in the train she turned her
face to the window and surreptitiously wiped
away the tears, though she longed to see fairy
godmother.</p>
<p>The hack whirled them to Loraine place.
The great trees stood like sentinels stretching
out their bare limbs. The beautiful autumn,
had gone, you noted it more here. Up the
stoop&mdash;how her heart beat, and yet somehow
she seemed as if she had lived another
lifetime.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear, dear Marilla,&#8221; cried Jane with
the warmest embrace. &#8220;We have missed you
so much, and are so glad to get you back.
Why it hasn&#8217;t seemed the same house, and
everybody has wanted you. Dr. Richards,
that Mrs. McCormick died this morning and
Miss Armitage was there until noon. Five
little children left, think of it, she came home
and went straight to bed, but she&#8217;s had a cup
of tea and will be down in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>They entered the parlor. Marilla took off
her hat and coat, it was so warm indoors.
She had on a new frock, a curious blue that
was very becoming. Her cheeks were a
lovely pink, her eyes full of expectancy.</p>
<p>Miss Armitage came down the back stairway
and through the library. Marilla gave
one cry and was in her arms.</p>
<p>No one had won her away, then. During
these days she had had many thoughts about
the child&#8217;s future. She had felt jealous of the
new found relatives and their love, of Dr.
Richards&#8217; devotion, of the happy times when
she had been counted out. Work had failed
to inspire, evenings had been lonely, dreary.
Oh, she would never let her go away again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
unless she went with her. She would beseech
the law to make the child hers&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fairy godmother!&#8221; The charming,
joyous tone that showed the child&#8217;s certainty
of a warm welcome. &#8220;It has all been so
lovely, but I wanted you so. I wanted you to
see the girls and their father who is the loveliest,
no not <i>quite</i> the loveliest,&#8221; and her eyes
shone with a tender radiance, the flush made
her beautiful. &#8220;For, fairy godmother, I have
a father now who will love me and care for me,
and I am filled to the brim with happiness&mdash;it
is better than the fortune. I could hardly
wait to tell you. Oh, please be glad for my
sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A father?&#8221; she repeated, in a breathless
tremulous sort of way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dr. Richards, and there was a
strange sort of assurance in his tone. He
seemed to have changed mysteriously&mdash;there
is a vigor, a power and withal a sweet satisfaction
in his face that gives her a pang she does
not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;The fortune is all
right. I have been made her guardian, but
that did not satisfy me. I have taken out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
papers of adoption, she is my child, my little
little daughter and she has a new, legal, lawful
name&mdash;Marilla Cinderella Richards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; The pathetic cry unnerved him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear fairy godmother it can&#8217;t make any
difference in my love for you. I loved you
first, you know. I shall always love you, but
I want us to live together and be as happy as
they are at the Warrens, and I love him, my
new father, so much. When you have something
of your very own it fills you everywhere
like beautiful music. I&#8217;ve been learning how
sweet and dear it can be. Oh, fairy godmother,
I want you both. It would break my heart
to lose either of you. Oh, fairy godmother,
can&#8217;t you love him; can&#8217;t you, won&#8217;t you marry
him and let us all live together?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a penetrating sweetness in the
pleading, but she saw the red of surprise mount
to the very edge of the man&#8217;s hair, and almost
a frown settle between the eyes. Her face
dropped to the silken soft head and she felt the
child&#8217;s heart beat tumultuously. To make the
two who loved her happy&mdash;to have them for
her own&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>She reached out her hand&mdash;it was her right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
hand. He caught it and pressed it to his lips
with a fervor that thrilled every pulse of her
being.</p>
<p>It was not the tie of kindred blood, but that
divine immortal kindred of love, and as he
clasped his arms about them both they were
Father, Mother and Child.</p>
<p>And so, Marilla had not only the Fairy Godmother,
but the Prince as well.</p>
